##### SECTION 5. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION

In this section you can find out more about

1.  Security of your personal information
2.  Personal information in the Arlo Communities and online
3.  Storing your personal information

**Security of your personal information**

We have implemented and continuously improve our technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.

As the security of your personal information depends in part on the effectiveness of the security of the devices (computer/ laptop/ mobile/ tablet/ etc) you use to communicate with us and the security measures you use to protect your access (User IDs and passwords), we encourage you to take necessary measures to protect this information.

Arlo wire-free cameras connect to the Arlo base station camera network using WiFI Protected Setup (WPS) and WPA2-AES data encryption. The WiFI connection is protected by a random, unique, long password that is not physically visible on the product. This password is programmed at the factory in the base station and re-generated upon factory-reset.

The Arlo base station connects to the backend through the customers home router using an Ethernet cable. Protective measures ensure that the base station is not accessible on the LAN.

The data is collected in a secure fashion, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used during the transportation of data. Accounts are authenticated using a secure login mechanism. We use one-way hashing in combination with salt for all passwords. Finally, we do not access or share any data unless required to by law or with your permission to help resolve system problems.

Payments: All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via secure communication methods and then securely stored into our payment gateway provider’s database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems. The payment gateway provider must keep the information confidential. Arlo Europe does not store payment information, instead such information is kept with our payment providers who are PCI compliant.

**Personal information in the Arlo Communities and online**

The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our or our partners sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords and not signing onto devices that you do not know. If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on an Arlo website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither we nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. We are not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.

**Storing your personal information**

Your personal information is stored for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this privacy notice. Where your information is no longer needed, we will take steps to ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you. We have established time limits for certain data deletion, taking into account the type of services provided in the context of the Products and Services, the length of our relationship with you, mandatory retention periods, and the statute of limitations.

In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements. For example, we are obliged in certain cases store your personal information for tax and accounting purposes for periods of up to ten years from the end of the year in which business relations with you ends.
