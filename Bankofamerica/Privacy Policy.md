If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Site from a different device, sign in under a different screen name or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.

### Additional Information

#### Aggregation Services

Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider"). To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.

*   The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
*   You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
*   Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.
*   We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.
*   If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
*   If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.
*   You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.

#### Social Media

Bank of America engages with customers on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, YouTube® and LinkedIn®.

*   Any content you post on official Bank of America managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms.
*   When interacting with official Bank of America social media pages, Bank of America's privacy notices, [Social Media User Terms](https://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/social-media/terms-of-use.html#fbid=44ruMLjSRZK) and [Community Guidelines](http://social.bankofamerica.com/) may apply.
*   Please review the privacy policy for the specific social media service you are using to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.

We may allow certain non-affiliated third party widgets (for example social share buttons) on our sites that enable users to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. The non-affiliated third parties that own these widgets may have access to information about your browsing on pages of our Sites and Mobile Apps where these widgets are placed.

### Online Behavioral Advertising

#### What is Online Behavioral Advertising?

Personal information collected from and about you online as described in this Notice is used and shared to deliver advertising and marketing, including prescreened offers of credit, which may be of interest to you.

We present tailored ads to you:

*   On our Sites and Mobile Apps through banner ads and splash ads that appear as your sign on or off of your online accounts
*   In off-line channels such as financial centers, call centers, and through direct marketing (for example. email, mail, phone)
*   On third party sites and mobile apps not affiliated with Bank of America.

#### How we tailor ads to you

*   **Advertising on our sites, mobile apps and off-line channels such as financial centers, call centers, and through direct marketing (for example email, mail, phone):** We may use certain personal information about your activities on our Sites and Mobile Apps, such as pages visited and key words entered, to help determine which of our ads or offers may be of interest to you. We may use personal information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information or the state in which you bank) to help determine which advertisements or offers to present to you.
*   **Advertising on non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps:** Bank of America contracts with advertising companies to advertise our products and services on sites and mobile apps not affiliated with us. We may use personal information we have collected or that you have provided to assist our non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps to select bank ads or offers that may appeal to you, display them to you and monitor your responses. Non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps are not subject to Bank of America Privacy Notices.

#### How you can opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising

You have choices about how Bank of America advertises to you based on your online behavior.

There is no standard for how "do not track" consumer browser settings should work for online advertising purposes. As such, we do not respond to browser "do not track" signals from browser settings. However, there are several opt out options available to you:

*   **Advertising on our Sites and Mobile Apps and off-line channels such as financial centers, call centers, and through direct marketing (for example email, mail, phone):** If you prefer we not provide you with tailored content and advertising based on your online behavior with our Sites and Mobile Apps, you may [opt out of online behavioral advertising](javascript:void(0);). Please review the important **Reminder** section that follows.
*   **Advertising on Non-Affiliated Third Party sites:** Bank of America participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and uses the Advertising Options Icon on our behavioral ads on non-affiliated third party sites (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). Ads served on our behalf by these companies do not contain unencrypted personal information and we limit the use of personal information by companies that serve our ads. To learn more about ad choices, or to opt out of interest-based advertising with non-affiliated third party sites, visit [YourAdChoices layer](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) powered by the Digital Advertising Alliance or through the [Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool layer](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). You may also visit the individual sites for additional information on their data and privacy practices and opt out-options.

#### Reminder

Please note that if you opt out of this advertising:

*   You may still receive untailored advertising from Bank of America.
*   When accessing online account servicing areas (i.e. after sign-in), such as Online Banking, Merrill Edge or MyMerrill, you may receive tailored content and advertising based on your account relationships.
*   Financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use personal information collected online as described in this Notice to provide details on products and services in accordance with account agreements.
*   In order for online behavioral advertising opt outs from our Sites and Mobile Apps and on other sites to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
*   If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Sites and Mobile Apps or other sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.
*   If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.

### Additional Information

#### Aggregation Services

Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider"). To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.

*   The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
*   You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
*   Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.
*   We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.
*   If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
*   If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.
*   You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.

#### Social Media

Bank of America engages with customers on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, YouTube® and LinkedIn®.

*   Any content you post on official Bank of America managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms.
*   When interacting with official Bank of America social media pages, Bank of America's privacy notices, [Social Media User Terms](https://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/social-media/terms-of-use.html#fbid=44ruMLjSRZK) and [Community Guidelines](http://social.bankofamerica.com/) may apply.
*   Please review the privacy policy for the specific social media service you are using to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.

We may allow certain non-affiliated third party widgets (for example social share buttons) on our sites that enable users to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. The non-affiliated third parties that own these widgets may have access to information about your browsing on pages of our Sites and Mobile Apps where these widgets are placed.

### Advertising Practices

We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.

Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.

If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may [opt out of online behavioral advertising](https://www.bankofamerica.com/security-center/online-privacy-notice/#advertising-on-our-sites). If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.

Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.

To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review [Bank of America Online Privacy Notice](https://www.bankofamerica.com/security-center/online-privacy-notice/) and our [Online Privacy FAQs](https://www.bankofamerica.com/security-center/faq/online-privacy/).
