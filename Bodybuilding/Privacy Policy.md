Nearly every international package we ship will pass through a major international sorting hub located in Frankfurt, Germany, before being forwarded to the destination country. This is not a cause for alarm if you see this information, your package will be leaving Germany very soon and the tracking will be updated again as it has reached your country's customs agency for clearance inspections.</p><h3>Timeframes</h3><p>Generally packages arrive in a very quick timeframe. In our experience, most packages reach customs within about 6-10 business days. Once your package has reached your government's customs agency, it must undergo clearance inspections. We do our best to speed-up this process by providing all of the required paperwork, but we are not able to determine exactly how long this will take for your order. Most of the time, packages are cleared within 5-7 business days and then handed-off to a local courier to complete delivery to you. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to speed this process.</p><p>Feel free to contact us if you feel your package is taking a unusually long time to reach you.

Bodybuilding.com is a trading name of Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd. We offer a wide range of products and services, and sometimes additional terms may apply. When you use a BBcom UK website feature (for example BodySpace, Gift Cards or BBcom UK applications for mobile devices), you will also be subject to the terms, guidelines and conditions applicable to that BBcom UK product or feature ('Service Terms'). If these Conditions of Sale are inconsistent with the Service Terms, those Service Terms will control.</p><p><b>Please read these conditions carefully before placing an order with Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd. By placing an order with Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd., you signify your agreement to be bound by these conditions.</b></p><h2>A. Our Contract</h2> <p>Your order is an offer to BBcom UK to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from BBcom UK, we will send you an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the 'Order Confirmation E-mail'). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the 'Dispatch Confirmation E-mail'). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail. Your contract is with Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd. Without affecting your right of withdrawal set out in section 2 below, you can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.</p><h2>B. Returns</h2> <p>Please review the <a>Returns</a> section in the Help section of the Store page which applies to products sold by BBcom UK.</p><p>BBcom UK does not take title to returned items until the items arrive at the returns address destination.

Pricing and Availability</h2> <p>All prices are inclusive of legally applicable VAT.</p><p>We list availability information for products sold by us on the website including on each product information page. Beyond what we say on that page or otherwise on the website, we cannot be more specific about availability. As we process your order, we will inform you by e-mail as soon as possible if any products you order turn out to be unavailable, delayed or on back order if we cannot ship an item for some reason or you cancel the order, and you will not be charged for those products.</p><p>Please note that unless otherwise stated on the website, delivery estimates are just that. They are not guaranteed delivery times and should not be relied upon as such.</p><p>Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalogue may be mispriced. We will verify pricing when processing your order and before we take payment. If we have made a mistake and a product's correct price is higher than the price on the website, we may either contact you before shipping to request whether you want to buy the product at the correct price or cancel your order. If a product's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and send you the product. </p><h2>D. Product Information</h2> <p>Unless expressly indicated otherwise, BBcom UK is not the manufacturer of the products sold on this website.

Your privacy is important to us and we would like our international customers to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.</p><h2>F. Our Liability</h2> <p>BBcom UK and its affiliates will not be responsible for (i) losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii) any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to both you and us when the contract for the sale of products by us to you was formed.</p><p>The laws of some countries do not allow some or all of the limitations described above. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above limitations may not apply to you and you might have additional rights.</p><p>Nothing in these conditions limits or excludes our responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.</p><p>We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.

If any of these Conditions of Sale is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p><h2>J. Waiver</h2> <p>If you breach these Conditions of Sale and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Sale.</p><h2>K.

Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalised or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing on our sites, use of devices, apps or software, visiting sites that contain BBcom UK content or ads, interacting with BBcom UK tools or using our payment services.</p><p>Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies (collectively, 'cookies'). Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites and other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly.</p><p>We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.</p><p>We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalised ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who bought or browsed for whey protein). Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p><p>Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the advertisements that appear on our sites directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this <a href='https://www.bodybuilding.com/help?legal-and-privacy&cookies-policy'>Cookies And Internet Advertising page</a>.

WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h2><p>Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device (e.g., computer, mobile phone, tablet, or any other mobile device) that you use to access any of the Bodybuilding.com Platforms (as defined in our Terms of Use). We collect these cookies for a number of purposes, including: (i) to recognize repeat users; (ii) enable you to use and access Bodybuilding.com’s Platforms; (iii) to help facilitate your navigation through and interaction with the Bodybuilding.com Platforms; (iv) to provide personalized content; and (v) for fraud detection and prevention. Specific types of cookies we collect are described below. Most cookies expire after a certain period of time depending on what we use it for. We use cookies for several reasons, which we describe below. </p><p>By using Bodybuilding.com’s Platforms, you expressly consent to the use of cookies as described on this page as well as in our Privacy Policy. You may adjust your cookie settings at any time as described in section 7 below.</p><h2>2. WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?</h2><p>Bodybuilding.com’s Platforms use both first-party cookies (which are set by the websites and/or mobile apps being visited) and third-party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our websites and/or mobile apps). </p><h2>3. FUNCTIONAL OR ESSENTIAL COOKIES</h2><p><span>(Example: login session cookies)</span></p><p>Certain cookies are necessary in order for Bodybuilding.com’s Platforms to operate correctly. For example, we use cookies to authenticate you. When you log on to our websites, authentication cookies are set which let us know who you are during a browsing session. Additionally, if you have created an account with Bodybuilding.com through a social media login, such as Facebook, these cookies allow us to facilitate such login on our website or mobile apps. Functional cookies do not include social media or advertising cookies, which are discussed below.</p><h2>4. EXPERIENCE OR PREFERENCE COOKIES</h2><p><span>(Example: language setting cookies; RTP Cookies – customizing content)</span></p><p>These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences (e.g. username and language selection) and are used to enable certain additional functionality on our websites, such as storing your preferences. This functionality improves user experience and allows us to customize your site experience accordingly. </p><h2>5. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ADVERTISING COOKIES</h2><p><span>(Examples: Facebook/Google Plus using social media for behavioral advertising, analytics, advertising and market research; AdRoll)</span></p><p>Social media cookies collect information about social media usage and allow you to connect to your social networks to share content from our website or mobile apps.</p><p>We may also use advertising cookies to market Bodybuilding.com products or services to you on third party websites. For example, if you visit our website, you may then see an advertisement for Bodybuilding.com products or services on certain third-party websites you visit in the future. Information about this is described under the paragraphs in our Privacy Policy entitled “Service Providers” and “Third Party Partners And Integrations.”</p><p>We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited our websites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after we receive it. This process helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p><p>We also contract with third-party advertising networks that may collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, emails, and on third-party websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting website navigational information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and ensure you receive a personalized experience.</p><h2>6. ANALYTICS COOKIES</h2><p><span>(Example of third party cookie: Optimizely/Google Analytics)</span></p><p>Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Bodybuilding.com Platforms, and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our website or mobile apps, help us record any difficulties you have (e.g., mobile app crashes), and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Platforms, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze Bodybuilding.com Platforms’ traffic to help create a better user experience. Analytics cookies may be classified as either functional, experience/preference, or social media/advertising cookies.</p><h2>7. HOW DO I MANAGE COOKIES?</h2><p>If you'd like to remove or disable cookies via your browser, you certainly can. You'll want to refer to your browser's configuration documentation (usually the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar) to do this since the steps for doing so are usually browser-specific. </p><p>Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel. </p>Your mobile device may allow you to control cookies through its settings function. Refer to your device manufacturer’s instructions/settings panel for more information. <p>For customers located in the EEA, you may adjust your Cookie Settings at any time by taking the following actions:</p><ul> <li>If you are accessing our site via a desktop browser, you can adjust your Cookie Settings by clicking the “Cookie Settings” link in the site footer below.</li><li>If you are accessing our site via a mobile app, or using any of Bodybuilding.com’s various mobile applications, you may access and adjust your Cookie Settings in the “Settings” menu in the mobile application.</li></ul><p>One important note is that if you do go this route, this might adversely impact your ability to use our services effectively.
