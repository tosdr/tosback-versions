**_Categories of Personal Information Sold._** The CCPA defines a “sale” as disclosing or making available to a third party personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. We disclose or make available personal information to dealers for marketing purposes, as well as other third parties, in order to receive certain services or benefits from them (such as when we allow third party tags to collect information such as browsing history on our Sites) to improve and measure our ad campaigns, including:

*   Name, contact information and other identifiers
*   Internet or other electronic network activity information
*   Geolocation data
*   Customer records
*   Commercial information
*   Inferences and profiles

**_California Residents’ Rights_**. California law grants California residents certain rights and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below.

· Notice before collection: we are required to notify California residents, at or before the point of collection of their personal information, the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which such information is used. You can find our notice at the top of this Privacy Policy.

· Do-not-sell: California residents have the right to opt-out of our sale of their personal information.  Opt-out rights can be exercised by submitting a request [here](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/abdee64f-f547-46bd-97a7-f56d58479fce/1c3a169b-1230-4a2e-b664-8785e3763e2c.html). We do not sell personal information about residents who we know are younger than 16 years old without opt-in consent.

· Request to delete: California residents have the right to request deletion of their personal information that we have collected about them and to have such personal information deleted, except where an exemption applies.

· Request to know: California residents have the right to request and, subject to certain exemptions, receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about them in the prior 12 months and to have this delivered, free of charge, either (a) by mail or (b) electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance. California residents also have the right to request that we provide them certain information about how we have handled their personal information in the prior 12 months, including the:

o categories of personal information collected;

o ategories of sources of personal information;

o business and/or commercial purposes for collecting and selling their personal information;

o categories of third parties/with whom we have disclosed or shared their personal information;

o categories of personal information that we have disclosed or shared with a third party for a business purpose; and

o categories of third parties to whom the residents’ personal information has been sold and the specific categories of personal information sold to each category of third party.

California residents may make a request to know up to twice every twelve (12) months.

**_Submitting Verifiable Requests._** To submit a request to know, or request to delete:

· Submit a request online [here](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/abdee64f-f547-46bd-97a7-f56d58479fce/1c3a169b-1230-4a2e-b664-8785e3763e2c.html).

We will respond to verifiable requests received from California residents as required by law.    

**_Right to Non-Discrimination_**_._ The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA. A business may offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of California residents’ personal information, provided it is not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent.  

**_You Rights Under California’s Shine-the-Light Law._** Under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide us their personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use; such requests may be made once per calendar year for information about any relevant third party sharing in the prior calendar year (so, requests submitted in 2020 would be applicable to relevant disclosures (if any) in 2019). If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing by emailing us at [dprivacy@fcagroup.com](mailto:dprivacy@fcagroup.com), using the subject line “**CA Shine the Light Request.**”  In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address.  We will reply to valid requests by sending a response to the email address from which you submitted your request.  Please note that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing and the relevant details required by the Shine the Light law will be included in our response.
