Maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks – such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure – through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.  
    
11.  Require that our vendors with whom student personal information is shared in order to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for the given student personal information.  
    
12.  Allow a successor entity to maintain the student personal information, in the case of our merger or acquisition by another entity, provided the successor entity is subject to these same commitments for the previously collected student personal information.

European Union – General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/index.htm))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GDPR is the newest body of regulation regarding the handling of personal data for citizens of the European Union (EU). The primary objective of the GDPR is to give citizens control of their personal data.  Select ClassLink products are compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation.  
  
GDPR includes 11 chapters and nearly 100 articles. Below are some of the most relevant articles.  

*   Article 5 “Principles relating to processing of personal data”: ClassLink is a trusted steward of personal data. Data received from customers are to be used solely for purposes of providing educational services. Such data will not be sold or used for marketing purposes.  
    
*   Article 17 “Right to be forgotten”: Schools can choose to delete users from ClassLink at any time. Individual users can choose to delete any data they’ve added to ClassLink at any time. ClassLink promptly deletes data associated with schools no longer working with ClassLink.  
    
*   Article 32 “Security of processing”: ClassLink keeps all personal data confidential and secure. ClassLink team members are bound by contractual non-disclosure agreements. ClassLink’s data security protections include: internal data management policies and procedures, limitations on access to personal data, data encryption (for both data in transit and at rest), data systems monitoring, incident response plans, and safeguards to ensure personal data is not accessed by unauthorized persons when transmitted over communication networks.  
    
*   Article 33 “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority”: GDPR requires notice to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of awareness of a personal data breach. Discovery of a security breach that results in an unauthorized release of personal data: ClassLink shall promptly notify affected customers of such breach, shall conduct an investigation, and shall restore the integrity of its data systems as soon as possible. ClassLink will fully cooperate and assist with required notices to those individuals affected by such breach.  
    
*   Article 35: “Data protection impact assessment”: ClassLink conducts various security assessments of our systems. Certain security tests are conducted annually, others more frequently and some other tests are running constantly.  
    
*   Article 37: “Designation of a data protection officer”: ClassLink maintains a designated data protection officer who is authorized to engage security reviews and impact product development.  
    
*   Article 44: “General principle for transfers”: To promote data sovereignty/data residency in GDPR, the regulation authorizes the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en) to decide if a third country or territory, where data may be transferred, meets adequate levels of protection. As GDPR is new, no third country or territory has yet been approved by the Commission. ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data. Customers located in the EU or UK utilize a secure data center located within the EU zone (Frankfurt, Germany). No servers, outside of these options, are used to store data for EU or UK based customers.  
    

![European Union Privacy Shield Badge](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d6db64572061db9c481aaeb/5e7e4426017d75d60b0ce839_privacy_shield.png)

European Union – Privacy Shield
-------------------------------

In July, 2016, the Privacy Shield framework was designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission, and the Swiss Administration to help companies comply with data protection requirements of the EU and Switzerland.  
  
ClassLink participates in the EU Privacy Shield. A list of participating organizations is available at [www.privacyshield.gov/list](http://www.privacyshield.gov/list).  
  
On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, invalidated the privacy shield as a substitute for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Privacy Shield continues to be in effect for Switzerland. A key factor contributing to the invalidation was the permissible transfer of personal data from the EU to the US under certain circumstances. ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data. ClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.  
  
ClassLink continues to participate in Privacy Shield and adhere to its guiding principles for the benefit of our customers in Switzerland.  
  
ClassLink conforms to the Privacy Shield Principles as follows:  

*   Notice: ClassLink publishes online privacy notices, including its participation in the Privacy Shield, its practices on collecting, using, and sharing personal data with third parties, its privacy practices, and choices available to individuals regarding limiting data collection and use.  
    
*   Choice: ClassLink will not share the customer’s data with third party vendors. ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.  
    
*   Accountability for Onward Transfer: ClassLink software enables the customer to control when and how their data is shared with third party vendors.  
    
*   Security: ClassLink takes all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the data owned by the customers that it serves from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access.  
    
*   Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation: ClassLink takes all reasonable and appropriate measures to limit processing to the purposes for which data has been collected, and to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.  
    
*   Access: ClassLink customers are always in control of their data, and can correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.  
    
*   Recourse, Enforcement and Liability: ClassLink protects against the unauthorized access of personal data through a variety of measures, including those enumerated within the EU standard contractual clauses related to data protection.  
    

ClassLink provides contact information on its website for inquiries or complaints regarding compliance with the Privacy Shield. The ClassLink contact web page is [classlink.com/contact](https://www.classlink.com/contact).  
  
ClassLink participates in the Independent Recourse Mechanism (IRM) provided by the European Union Dispute Resolution Procedures (EU DPAs) for Privacy Shield dispute resolution.  
  
ClassLink is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission or the appropriate statutory body that will ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.

United States – Children’s Internet Protection Act ([CIPA](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‍**The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires schools and libraries receiving certain e-Rate benefits from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adhere to policies that provide safe internet experiences for minors. These include policies related to:  

*   Preventing access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet;  
    
*   The safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications;  
    
*   Unauthorized access, including so-called “hacking,” and other unlawful activities by minors online;  
    
*   Unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and  
    
*   Measures restricting minors’ access to materials harmful to them.  
    

Although ClassLink does not itself prevent access to inappropriate websites, that burden belongs to the school or library, ClassLink can help create an intentional internet experience for young students by enabling instant access to positive online resources from any device.

Colorado - The Student Data Transparency and Security Act
---------------------------------------------------------

ClassLink is compliant with the regulations put forth by the Colorado Department of Education. Effective August 10, 2016, the [Student Data Transparency and Security Act (PDF)](https://www.cde.state.co.us/dataprivacyandsecurity/crs22-16-101) (HB16-1423; C.R.S.22-16-101 et seq.), brought statewide attention to Student Data Privacy. The purpose of this Law is to increase the transparency and security of all Student Personally Identifiable Information (Student PII) that the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) and [Local Education Providers](https://www.cde.state.co.us/dataprivacyandsecurity/definitionspage) (LEPs) collect and maintain. The Law aims to maximize trust in the use of student data in the elementary and secondary education system, by having vendors contracting with schools or educational agencies in Colorado contractually agree to comply with certain requirements if they are to collect information from students.
