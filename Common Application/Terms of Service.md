The Site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including affiliated web sites which may or may not be owned or operated by the Common App. The Common App has not reviewed all of the web sites that are or may be linked to the Site, and The Common App has no control over such sites. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the Common App is not responsible for the content of such web sites, any updates or changes to such sites, or the privacy or other practices of such sites, and the fact that the Common App offers such links does not indicate any approval or endorsement of any material contained on any linked site. the Common App is providing these links to you only as a convenience.

**6\. Claims of Copyright Infringement**

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Common App infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow the Common App to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by the Common App against you, the DMCA permits you to send the Common App a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [**http://www.loc.gov/copyright/**](http://www.loc.gov/copyright/) for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to CT Corporation System, 4701 Cox Rd, Glen Allen, VA 23060-6802. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
