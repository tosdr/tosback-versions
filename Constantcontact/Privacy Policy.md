**ABOUT US**
------------

Constant Contact, Inc. (“Constant Contact”) is a leading provider of online tools for small and medium businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations to connect with their contacts or customers through email marketing, social media, websites and more. We refer to the products and services that are ordered by our customers and made available online by Constant Contact, as described at [https://www.constantcontact.com](https://www.constantcontact.com/), as the “Services.”

Our Services help our customers provide timely and relevant marketing and communications on a cross-media basis. Our clients can upload contact lists and use our platform to reach their customers and others, for instance, through email and other channels. Personal information and other data submitted by or on behalf of a customer to the Services, including contact lists (which may include email addresses and other information for a customer’s contacts) and content (including the content of a customer’s campaigns) (collectively, “Customer Data”), belongs to and is controlled by our customers. Constant Contact does not process Customer Data except as provided in our online user agreements with our customers, available [here](https://go.constantcontact.com/legal/terms). We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our Customers, including with respect to the personal information they collect or upload to our Services.

This privacy notice and our [Cookie Notice](http://www.constantcontact.com/cookie-notice) collectively provide details about our practices relating to personal information collected from or about visitors to our websites, our customers, and others (collectively, our “Users” or “you”). It describes how your personal information is collected, used and shared by us in the course of operating our website and our business.

The Customer Data that we handle on behalf of our customers is not collected on our website, but rather through our customers’ independent use of our platform.  For example, our customers may use our platform to encourage their contacts to sign up for their email lists. Emails sent from the Constant Contact platform include single pixel gifs, also known as web beacons, which contain unique identifiers that enable us and our customers to recognize when their contacts have opened an email or clicked certain links. These technologies record each contact’s email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click for an email campaign. We use this data to create reports for our customers about how an email campaign performed and what actions their contacts took.  For more information about how we process Customer Data, please review our [Customer Contact Data Notice](http://www.constantcontact.com/customer-contact-data-notice).

This privacy notice only applies to our Users’ personal information.  It does not apply to any of our customers’ contacts’ personal information included in the Customer Data.  When we receive our customers’ contacts’ personal information from our customers, we are acting in the role of a processor or service provider, including when we offer to our customers various products and services through which our customers (or their affiliates): (i) create their own websites and applications running on our platforms; (ii) sell or offer their own products and services; (iii) send electronic communications to their contacts through our Services; or (iv) otherwise collect, use, share or process personal information via our Services.

In addition to this privacy notice, the following addenda related to individuals in certain locations also apply to your purchase or use of those Services where applicable. These addenda are a part of this privacy notice:

*   [Addendum for Users in California](http://www.constantcontact.com/california-addendum)
    
*   [GDPR Addendum for Users in the European Union](http://www.constantcontact.com/gdpr-addendum) (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK)

### SHARING WITHIN THE ENDURANCE CORPORATE FAMILY

Constant Contact is a subsidiary of The Endurance International Group, Inc. (“Endurance”).  We occasionally share business contact or other information about our customers with other members of the Endurance corporate family to improve our products and services and so that Constant Contact may better provide you with information about Endurance’s offers, services or products that may be of interest to you. Any such corporate affiliate may use your information only according to the terms of this privacy notice. If you are located in a jurisdiction where such sharing requires your permission, we will only do so with your consent.

### SHARING WITH PARTNERS

The information we share with our partners includes your name, email address and other information enabling our partners to assist you in using our Services.

Our partners may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts and similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising [click here](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) or [click here](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) to opt out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device(s).

If you are located in a jurisdiction where such sharing requires your permission, we will only do so with your consent.

Further, our partners are prohibited from using your contact information for any purpose beyond those set forth above without your consent. We will not provide our partners with your credit card information. If you are working with a partner, such as a Constant Contact Solution Provider, and would like that partner to have full access to your account, including the ability to send emails on your behalf, we will provide access to just that partner upon your request or consent. 

In the event we collect information from you in connection with an offer that is jointly presented by us and a partner, we will let you know who is collecting the information and whose privacy notice applies, as well as any options you may have regarding use of your information.

The transmission of information via the internet, email or text message is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted through the Services or over email; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized use, access or modification.

**THIRD PARTY LINKS AND INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY OUR USERS**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of our Services provide links to other websites. Because we do not control the information policies or practices of these third party sites, you should review their privacy policies to learn about how they collect and use personal information.

You may also log in to some of our Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you with the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. For example, if you take advantage of certain of our social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site, the applicable social networking sites may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable it to function properly.

**REFER A FRIEND**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our website. We retain this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Such referrals may not be permissible in all situations or in all jurisdictions. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws in this regard including, if applicable, seeking consent from your friend. Your friend may contact us at privacy@constantcontact.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
