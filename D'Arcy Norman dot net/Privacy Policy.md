This website doesn’t track anything, and doesn’t set any cookies. I don’t track statistics beyond what is done by the Apache webserver. I occasionally look at high level statistics through [Analog](https://analog.readthedocs.io/) or [AWStats](https://www.awstats.org/) processing of those logs.

Search functionality is provided by [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (via a search form at the bottom of every page), but I don’t think DDG sets any cookies or tracks you. [DuckDuckGo has a published privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy).
