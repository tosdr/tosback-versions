We shall not discriminate against you because you have exercised your rights under the CCPA.

10. Data retention and account deletion
---------------------------------------

 We store your data for no longer than necessary in relation to the purpose under which such data was collected. This is determined on a case by case basis and depends on things such as the nature of the data provided, why it was collected, the legal basis we rely upon to process the data, and our relevant legal or operation retention requirements. For example, if you request to delete your account, we still have to retain some data for fraud prevention purposes and financial auditing.

Please note that we evaluate deletion requests against our processing for the purposes of journalism, which includes original content and accompanying comments. When we receive a request to delete your personal data from our organisation, we are prepared to anonymise your comments by removing your email address and alias from your public account profile. In doing so, your comments are disassociated with your public account profile and therefore you are no longer publicly identified as the author of your comments. However, we keep your data because we may receive claims for libel and or/defamation in relation to user comments.

When you use our websites and apps, we may collect information using cookies or similar technologies. We may also collect information using your email address. For the purposes of this section, we use the word “cookies” for simplicity. 

What are cookies and how do they work?

Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you. This allows websites to tailor what you see on the screen.

Do you use other technologies which are similar to cookies?

Yes, we use the following:

*   Web beacons: Our websites, apps and emails often contain small invisible images known as "web beacons" or "tracking pixels". These are used in a way similar to\_cookies to:

\- understand when a particular part of a webpage, email or app is viewed, 

\- understand how successful an article or an email marketing campaign has been; and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails

*   Flash cookies: In certain situation we use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video clips. Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. 

*   Tracking URLs: These are web links that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read.

*   Device identifiers: We use device identifiers on mobile devices in the same way as cookies are used on web browsers. A device identifier is a unique number on your device which allow us to remember your device.

We use these similar technologies on websites, emails and apps, for the same purposes and in much the same way as we use cookies on websites. We shall use “cookies” and “websites” below as shorthand for “cookies and similar technologies” on “websites, emails and in apps”. 

What do you use cookies for?

Cookies and other online tracking technologies are an important part of the internet. They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites.

There are many different uses for cookies, but for within our sites, they fall into the following groups:

*   Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for (Essential / Strictly Necessary ) 

Some cookies are essential so you can move around our websites and use their features. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function.

*   Cookies that collect information about your choices and preferences (Functional / Preference) 

These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like: 

\- your username and keeping you logged in during your visit - without cookies you might have to log in on every page you go to;

\- when you add something to the online shopping basket, cookies make sure it is still there when you get to the checkout;  

\- Remembering a location you've provided us with so we can show you relevant content to where you are and to provide local weather forecasts; 

\- If you have filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again;

\- showing “related article” links that are relevant to the page you are looking at.

*   Cookies used to understand how people use our products and services (Analytics) 

 We use analytics cookies to gather information about what pages, links and sections of our apps are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. They are also useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate our sites so we can identify improvements to make to the customer journey

*   Cookies used to show advertising that is relevant to you (Tracking and Advertising)

Cookies are placed on your browser to remember the websites you have visited. Also, when you log into your account, we can recognise your UID. Advertising based on what you have been looking at is then displayed to you when you visit websites who use the same advertising networks.

To help us deliver relevant advertising using cookies, we use Google Double Click. Click [here](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/) to find out more about Google Double Click.

We also use these cookies in order to:

*   know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked or hovered over with a mouse cursor, how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these generate; 
*   understand which customers reach a sale or other action page on an advertiser's site. This allows us to monitor how many sales or actions we achieve for an advertising client, and therefore, how effective our advertising is; and  
*   protect our advertisers' brands, we often use a technology that scans the page to ascertain that it is safe from profane, sensitive & potentially brand-negative topics, before serving an ad there. This process is called 'ad verification'.

This information may be stored or associated with your device (including through the use of cookies) to re-insert advertisements on our websites and to understand how our customers use ad-blockers.
