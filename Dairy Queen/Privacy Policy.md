Hey there!

Welcome to our Privacy Statement.

##### Where does this privacy statement apply?

*    This privacy statement applies to your activity on the following websites (we'll call these the "Websites" in this statement):

*   DQ.com
*   DQCakes.com
*   orangejulius.com
*   DQ.ca
*   orangejulius.ca
*   dairyqueenfranchising.com
*   dqcandlecollection.com
*   dqfanfeedback.com
*   dqfansurvey.com

*   Your personal information may be processed and stored in the U.S. of another country, and the government, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that country may by law be able to obtain your personal information.

##### Where ISN'T it relevant?

*    Most _DQ_® restaurants are independently owned and operated franchises, and some of them have their own websites or email clubs - we don't own, operate, or control any of those. Also, when you search for a location, some of our franchisees have a “Careers” link that allows you to send your résumé to that franchise. This information doesn’t come to us at the _DQ_® corporate headquarters. It is sent directly to the franchisee.
*   If you follow links on our site to any site that isn’t one of our Websites – say, to purchase gift cards or _DQ_® gear – you’ll be leaving the realm of our policy. You should check out the privacy policies of those sites to find out how they treat your data!

If you use our Websites, you agree to these terms. We may change them, and when we do, continuing to use the Websites means you agree to the new terms.

##### Collection

We collect Personal Information (any information about an identifiable individual) in a few different ways.

##### Information You Submit

Fan Clubs

*   _What:_ When you sign up for Blizzard® Fan Club or Julius League®, you give us your country, zip code, name, birth month and day, and email address. We also ask for your favorite Blizzard® Treat flavor!
*   _Why:_ Well, your name and email address tell us how to communicate with you about new fancy flavors, _Blizzard_® Treats of the Month, and all that – along with some pictures we hope make you drool! And your zip code, well, this helps us figure out where we have lots of fans! That helps us make better decisions about marketing, and where we might need a new _DQ_® restaurant! We use your country to make sure you are getting product info relevant to you, as we have some different menu items in the US versus Canada (poutine anyone?). Your birth day and month? Well, so we can send you a special message on your special day! We love to recognize our fans!

Contests or Sweepstakes

*   _What:_ Sometimes we run contests or sweepstakes through the Websites, social media, or other fun marketing venues. When we do that, we may also ask if you want to be added to one of our fan clubs! If that happens, just bop back up to the fan clubs section to understand the what and why. If you don’t agree to be added to our fan club, then your information is kept until the end of the sweepstakes or contest (so that we can choose a winner or winners and make sure whatever fun prizes are associated with the sweepstakes or contest get sent out). We may ask for different information for each contest or sweepstakes, because, well, each is unique! That’s what makes them so fun! We’ll let you know in the contest or sweeps rules what information we’re collecting, but all the info about how we handle the information is found right here in this privacy statement!
*   _Why:_ We collect this information so that we can choose a winner or winners, and so that we can fulfill any prize obligations.

Product Surveys

*   _What:_ We are all about making sure the new products we are mixing up are tasty and delicious and what you want! To make sure we are on the right track, we’ll sometimes we run some surveys. We have a couple different kinds – we may ask our fan club members about what they like or dislike, and in that we might collect different sorts of information. Participation in these types of surveys is always voluntary, and it’s anonymized as soon as possible and personal information deleted. We also sometimes test new products at certain super-secret stores and if you are lucky enough to catch one of these test products, we may ask you to complete a survey about the product. For these product surveys, we ask for your email address, age range, and gender. When you complete a test product survey, we’ll also ask if you want to be added to one of our fan clubs. If that happens, head on back to the fan clubs section to understand the what and why of our collection.
*   _Why:_ For all of our surveys, we collect this information so that we can improve our products or our marketing. For the test product surveys, we collect your email address so we can offer you a coupon for helping us out, and we ask for your age range and gender to help us ensure the product we’re testing has a wide range of consumer appeal. The individual data gets rolled up to into statements like “this flavor skewed 60% female” or “the Sour Patch Kids _Blizzard®_ treat skews towards Millennials.”

Experience Surveys

*   _What_: We love making happy for our fans! To see if our fans are having a good experience at our stores, sometimes we’ll ask you to complete a survey after your visit through a website listed on your _DQ_®receipt. Depending on how you describe your experience, you may be asked you if you want to be contacted by the franchisee of the location you visited and asked for your name, phone number, and email address.
*   _Why_: Your information will be shared with the location you visited so they can reach out to you about your experience since they are in the best position to make it right! We also use the data to track info about the most common issues, resolution time, etc. as we continually strive to improve service at _DQ_® stores!

DQCakes.com

*   _What:_ When you order a cake, we collect your name, phone number, and email address. We also keep the record of you purchasing the cake, including all of the details about that order.
*   _Why:_ So we can provide you the cake you ordered! We also use this information to help the restaurant fulfilling your order to communicate with you about that order. We also use it for marketing purposes, and to aggregate some reports about cake orders, so that we can figure out things like what cake flavors and toppers are most popular.

Product Sales

*   _What:_ We don’t generally offer products directly to our fans. This sounds a little odd because it seems like we are an ice cream company, right? Well, not exactly. As we mentioned earlier, most _DQ_® restaurants are independently owned and operated franchises, which means it’s the owner of each store that is selling delicious _DQ_® products. In addition, the “Gift Cards and Gear” link on our website is run by a licensed third party vendor. Every once in a while though, we decide there is a special enough opportunity that we want to offer special products to our fans. A great example of this is our limited time offer fall _Blizzard_® Treat candle collection. How will you know that we are running the offer instead of a third party vendor? Well, the easiest way is to check out the privacy statement on the website. If it links to this one right here, then you know! In these situations, we generally collect your name, email address, phone number, and shipping address.
*   _Why:_ We collect your email address and phone number so we communicate with you about your order, and your name and shipping address so we can have your purchase sent to you.

Fan Relations Interactions

*   _What:_ When you use the “Contact Us” page on our Websites, you may give us  your name, postal address, phone number, and email address. We’ll also ask for details about why you are contacting us. If you call us, we’ll ask for the same info.
*   _Why:_ We really want to make sure that our fans are treated right! If you have a comment about a specific DQ restaurant, we also want to get you in touch with the restaurant that handled your experience – they’re the ones who are in the best position to make it right! So, we send this information on to them.
*   _Reminder:_ Most of our restaurants are independently owned and operated franchises – we recommend that you contact them first, because they can usually address your concern or celebration more directly. We don’t guarantee any of their privacy practices.

Developing a franchise

*   _What:_ When you use the “Own a DQ Location” page on dairyqueenfranchising.com (for US or Canada), you may give us some information – a contact name, postal address, phone number, email address, and information about your timeline, net worth, and capacity for investment. Or for international opportunities, if you contact us via email or phone (such as at internationaldevelopment2@idq.com or at another email address or phone number) you may give us your name, email address, and phone number. 
*   _Why:_ We use this information to help us decide if your business meets our minimum requirements for new franchisees, to help us prioritize interested businesses, and to contact you about available opportunities if it looks like a good fit. Like any good relationship, we may want to get to know each other more, and we may ask you to fill out an application or provide more information about your qualifications, which may include current and previous home address, employment information, more financial information, marital status and spouse’s name. Once everyone is feeling confident in the relationship and decides to move forward with a franchise, then a different privacy statement applies to franchisees.

**Information Collected or Used Automatically**

*   IP Address

*   _Say what?_ Your IP Address (“internet protocol address”) is a unique series of numbers that is associated with the device you’re using to access the internet. (Want to know yours? Type “What’s my IP address?” into most web search tools and you’ll find out!)
*   _And why?_ We collect your IP address when you order a cake on DQCakes.com, so that we can tell whether you’re in the US or in Canada and then show you the cakes that are offered in that country. In addition, if you take one of our product or experience surveys, the survey vendor may collect your IP address to keep track of which IP address has already done the survey.

*   Reporting & Analytics

*   _What:_ We anonymize and aggregate data about how our fans interact with our brand.
*   _Why:_ This helps us make better decisions about everything, from what kind of Blizzard® Treat to come up with next, to how much support we need for really old browsers.

**A word about cookies**

*   _What:_ Cookies are tiny pieces of code that your web browser stores.
*   _Why:_ They help us show you the kind of content that you probably want to see. For example, if you choose the Canadian version of our site, a cookie remembers that, and will show you the Canadian version of the next page on our Websites that you visit – as well as next time you navigate to our Websites. We don’t store any of this data in a way that would let us associate it with a specific person.
*   _Other parties' cookies:_

*   We use Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. To do this, Google feeds your browser a cookie with a randomly-generated ClientID, and also collects your IP address, which Google anonymizes. Google provides us a report with no personal information in it that helps us understand things like how people find and get to our Websites, what people are looking for when they visit us, what ad campaigns help us entice fans to our restaurants, and how we could make our Websites better. If you want more information about how Google Analytics uses data, you can check it out here: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) or by navigating to Google’s Product Privacy Guide and looking at the links related to Google Analytics. You can opt out of having your data used by Google Analytics by downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on found [here.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
*   Facebook feeds your browser a cookie when you visit our Websites so that your browser can request DQ® ads (amongst other ads, requested by your browser because of different cookies it’s eaten on other websites you’ve visited). You can read more about how Facebook uses data here: [https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies/](https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies/). (You can also get to this page by navigating to Facebook’s page and looking for the link to “Cookies” at the bottom of the page.)
*   Some of our advertising service vendors may also feed your browser cookies when you visit our Websites, in order to help us tailor advertising to you when you visit other websites, and to provide us information about how our fans interact with our advertising and how it relates to traffic on our Websites.
*   Other parties’ cookies on other websites: Many companies use cookies that track your activity across different websites and collect information about how you interact with content and advertisements. Some of our vendors track information about how fans interact with our advertisements when they see the DQ® brand representin’ on another page, but they don’t collect information associated with a fan – they collect stuff like “how many clicks did this ad get on this site”.

*   _I don’t like cookies._ Hey, we make treats for all kinds! If you would rather not have these cookies, you can use your browser’s cookie settings to control which cookies your browser eats! This is usually managed through a “Settings” menu, although you may have to delve into the “Advanced” segment. You can also control more about how many cookies are a part of your browser’s balanced diet by looking into the YourAdChoices program from the [US Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/), or the [Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

**Sharing is Caring**  
. . but sometimes less is more. We don’t really like sharing information, but sometimes we just gotta! So who do we share with?

  

*   **One big happy company family.** We share data within the DQ®/Orange Julius® family of companies, mostly because we all work together out of the same office spaces and try to streamline where we can. Our family includes American Dairy Queen Corporation and Orange Julius of America, which are U.S. based companies, and Dairy Queen Canada Inc. and Orange Julius Canada Limited, which are Canadian companies.
*   **Franchisees.** Most of the time, your information stays here at our corporate headquarters. But sometimes the best one to take care of you is the franchisee who owns your local DQ® restaurant! We share some information with our franchisees when you order a cake from them, we’ll share some when you get in touch with our Fan Relations team about a celebration or a concern related to a specific DQ® location, and we’ll share some info from an experience survey if you tell us you want to be contacted by the location about your experience.
*   **Vendors.** We’re actually a pretty small team around here, so we get a little help from our friends. These are companies with pretty specialized skills, and any company who gets personal information about you from us has agreed that they’ll only use your personal information for exactly what we ask them to do. These vendors may help us with things like hosting, data management and storage, marketing or remarketing, website or marketing analytics, email services for our loyalty clubs, services to assist us with responding to you if you send us a comment, question, or complaint, for contest or sweepstakes administration and fulfillment, for employment application processing, surveys, product fulfillment, and other similar services.
*   **Police & legal people.** We will share information if we are required to by law, or if we need to in order to cooperate with an investigation or defend our family of companies.
*   **New owners.** Hey, we’d be just as surprised as the next fan, but if we merge, sell, or otherwise reorganize in our corporate family, we’ll pass on your personal information as part of the deal.

**For our visitors from California.**
-------------------------------------

*   California’s Business and Professions Code section 22575 requires us to disclose how we respond to “do not track” signals. We currently take no action to respond to “do not track” signals.

To request this information, contact privacy@idq.com.

*   The categories of personal information that the business disclosed about the resident for a business purpose.

*   Section 1798.125: California residents have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA.

*   Method for submitting requests: To exercise any of your rights under this law, please fill out the form at [this link](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/9d08013a-e357-4ab3-a62e-e4b11eb0e644/b847de5c-1ee6-4a3f-bfd9-eb2988280bcb.html) or call 1-866-793-7582 to submit a request. When you submit a request, you will need to provide your name, email address, state, country, and details about your request. We’ll send a link to the email you provide and ask you to click on that link to confirm that it’s really you.

*   Pro-tip: We love to hear from our fans! But the link above is pretty specific to privacy stuff, so if you have non-privacy questions or comments, you’ll have a much better experience reaching out to our fabulous fan relations team using [this link](https://www.dairyqueen.com/us-en/Company/Contact-Us/) instead.

*   More specific info about what we’ve collected in the last 12 months:

*   With respect to Section 1798.110(c):

*   We collect these categories of personal information:

*   IDENTIFIERS. These identify you as a person, such as your name, postal address, email address, or IP address
*   COMMERCIAL INFORMATION. Purchasing history and other stuff like that.
*   INTERNET OR OTHER ELECTRONIC NETWORK ACTIVITY INFORMATION. Data like browsing or search history.
*   INFERENCES. This sounds a little vague, but basically it means that we may take all the information we have about you and make some inferences about your preferences (um, you’d much prefer that Blizzard® Treat flavor with the chocolate, amirite?).

*   Categories of sources from which personal information is collected: We collect personal information from you directly, either when you give it to us or one of our vendors, or automatically, when you interact with or fill out forms on our Websites.
*   Business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal information: We collect information to fulfill orders, email you, inform our decisions about product and new restaurant development, make our customer service better, and to qualify prospective franchisees. You can find more information about why we collect this information above.
*   Categories of third parties with whom personal information is shared: We share information within our family of companies, with our franchisees as we described earlier in this privacy policy, and with vendors who provide data analytics services, data and communications management services, customer relations services, delivery and loyalty program services, survey services, product fulfillment services, and operating systems and platforms.
*   Any California resident has a right to request the specific pieces of information the business has collected about the them.

*   With respect to Section 1798.115:

*   List of categories of personal information sold: none.
*   List of categories of personal information disclosed: IDENTIFIERS, COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, INTERNET OR OTHER ELECTRONIC NETWORK ACTIVITY INFORMATION, and INFERENCES.

*   Right to Opt-out. Since we don’t and won’t sell any personal information under the definition of Section 1798.140(t), you don’t have to do anything to opt-out.
*   We know you have a lot on your plate, so if you would like to designate an authorized agent to exercise any of your CCPA rights, shoot privacy@idq.com an email from the email address on your account, with the name and email address of your agent. Don’t we all have multiple email addresses, right? Well, we need it to be from the email address on your account because that’s how we verify that it is a legitimate request. We want to make sure we are taking actions that you authorized (instead of your uncle’s best friend’s daughter’s neighbor named Carl).
*   The CCPA allows us to offer fans financial incentives for sharing their personal information with us. We don’t do it very often, but we do sometimes offer perks if you give us your info. Things like the mobile app rewards program, which we need personal information to offer, otherwise we have no way to track how many sweet rewards points you have! Another example is that we ask for your info to enter a contests or sweepstakes. Your participation in these types of things is always optional and you can head back up to the beginning of this privacy statement to understand the what and why.

**Additional Info for EU Residents**
