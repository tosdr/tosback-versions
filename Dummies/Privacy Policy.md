Wiley also  may disclose navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics and demographic information that does not reveal your identity or personal information.

Cross Border Transfers
----------------------

Wiley may transfer your personal information outside of your country of residence for the following reasons:

*   In order to process your transactions, we may store your personal information on our servers and those servers may reside outside the country where you live. Wiley has servers and major office locations in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, Brazil, India and Australia. Wiley also has service providers located in India and the Philippines amongst other countries. Such processing may include, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
*   In order to satisfy global reporting requirements, Wiley may be required to provide your personal information to Wiley affiliates in other countries.

By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of your information. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection laws.

In relation to personal data processed within the US, Wiley has in place EU Model Clauses between entities within its group of companies that receive and process personal information from countries within the European Economic Area.

Security
--------

We will use appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect your data.  Access to your personal data will be restricted to only those who need to know that information and required to perform their job function.  In addition, we train our employees about the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and security of your information.

Disclosure in Chat Rooms or Forums
----------------------------------

You should be aware that identifiable personal information — such as your name or e-mail address — that you voluntarily disclose and that is accessible to other users (e.g. on social media, forums, bulletin boards or in chat areas) could be collected and disclosed by others. Wiley cannot take any responsibility for such collection and disclosure.

Cookies
-------

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.

Wiley and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or services.

Under the [California Consumer Privacy Act](#15), California residents have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information to third parties. While Wiley does not believe that its use of Web cookies constitutes a “sale” of personal information under CCPA, Wiley has published the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page to offer the opt-out option to California residents.

Your Rights
-----------

You have the right to make a written request to be informed whether or not we hold or process any of your personal information (by emailing [privacy@wiley.com](mailto:privacy@wiley.com)). In your written request, you may:

*   Request that we provide you with details of your personal information that we process, the purpose for which it is processed, the recipients of such information, the existence of any automated decision making involving your personal information, and what transfer safeguards we have in place;
*   Request that we rectify any errors in your personal information;
*   Request that we delete your personal information if our continued processing of such information is not justified;
*   Request that we transfer your personal information to a third party;

*   Object to direct marketing from us; and
*   Object to processing for purposes of scientific, historical research and statistics.

Where applicable under your local laws, we will not use your personal information for marketing purposes, nor disclose your information to any third parties, unless we have your prior consent, which we will seek before collecting your personal information. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the consent forms we use when collecting your personal information. If at any point you wish to review or change your preferences you can use the “opt-out” or unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within the communications that you receive from us. Note that you may still receive transactional communications from Wiley.

Your California Data Privacy Rights
-----------------------------------

### Information About Data We Have Collected or Disclosed About You

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides additional data privacy rights to California residents. You have the right to request that we provide, not more than twice every 12 months, certain information about the data we have collected or disclosed about you over the past 12 months, including:

*   the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
*   the categories of sources from which we have collected your personal information;
*   the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;

### Disclosure of Personal Information

For certain of our business functions, we may disclose personal information for a business purpose. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, the third party must agree to retain, use, or disclose the personal information solely for the business purpose. We prohibit the third party from selling the personal information that we provide \[for a business purpose\]. In the past 12 months, depending on how you interact with Wiley, we may have disclosed your information as set forth in the section above entitled “Disclosure and Sharing of Your information.”

### Deletion of Data

California residents also have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (and direct our service providers to do so), except where retaining your personal information is necessary for Wiley to:

*   Complete your transaction, provide a good or service you requested, or perform a contract between you and us;
*   Protect you or us from security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity;
*   Fix errors in our systems;
*   Protect your, our, or others’ right to free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law;
*   Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (California Penal Code Section 1546 and following);

*   Use your personal information internally in a way that is reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us or in another lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information; or
*   Comply with a legal obligation.

### “Do Not Track” (for California and Delaware Residents)

Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” (a/k/a/ DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. For more information about “do not track”, go to [https://allaboutdnt.com/](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

Additional Information Regarding Children’s Privacy
---------------------------------------------------

If we ask a child age 13 or under to provide us with certain information such as the child’s full name, home address, email address, telephone number, age information or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child, we ask for a parent or guardian’s consent for a child to provide that information. We may use the parent’s email address to seek the parent’s consent or notify the parent of his/her child’s online activities. We do not share the children’s information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy for their own marketing purposes. If you would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted from our active servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child’s information or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at [privacyamericas@wileycom](mailto:privacyamericas@wileycom), or at John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Attention: Chief Privacy Officer, 111 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030.
