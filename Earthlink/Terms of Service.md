**5\. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE SERVICES**

The Service consists of the combination of DSL Internet access and phone service and DSL Internet access, with various other Internet-related services such as email and web space. You should use the EarthLink Modem for the DSL portion of the Service and your own equipment for the phone portion of the Service. EarthLink’s self-installation kit includes the software that you may use to access the Service (“EarthLink Access Software”). The minimum computer requirements for the EarthLink Access Software are located at [www.earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net/).

The Service will be used in a fixed location in qualifying areas of the United States and is for residential purposes only. This is not a business service. You will not resell or transfer the Service or the EarthLink Modem to another party without the prior written consent of EarthLink. EarthLink reserves the right to immediately cancel or modify your Service if EarthLink determines, in its sole and absolute discretion that your use of the Service or the EarthLink Modem is, or at any time was, inconsistent with normal fixed residential usage patterns or for any other reason. You will use the Service and the EarthLink Modem only for lawful purposes.

The Service quality can vary depending on location, line quality, inside wiring, Internet traffic, and other factors beyond the control of EarthLink. EarthLink does not guarantee call quality or upload or download speeds and your sole remedy is to cancel the Service.

The Service may not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 511 and/or other x11 (other than certain specified dialing such as 711 and 911, which is provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) services in one or more (or all) service areas. If you obtained a phone number from EarthLink, it will not be listed in any phone directories. Phone numbers transferred from your local phone company may; however, be listed if they were listed prior to porting.

The Service may not be compatible with home security systems. You are responsible for contacting your alarm monitoring company to test the compatibility of any alarm monitoring or security system with the Service.

You are solely responsible for determining if use of a particular dial-up number will cause you to incur long-distance, toll, or any other charges. EarthLink is not responsible for any long-distance, toll, or other charges you incur. EarthLink may change its POP numbers at any time. EarthLink reserves the right to direct you to use certain numbers to access the Service or to restrict use of specific access numbers. Usernames, passwords, email addresses and IP addresses are EarthLink’s property and EarthLink may alter or replace them at any time.

The Service also includes a dial-up connection to the Internet for up to 20 hours per monthly billing cycle. In calculating the 20 hours of usage, the dial-up usage of each Device logged into your EarthLink account to access the Internet is counted. For example, if you have two Devices logged in from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., your total usage for that time period will be 2 hours of usage. If your dial-up connection usage exceeds 20 hours per month, you will be charged an additional $1.00 per hour (up to a maximum of $21.95 per month), pro-rated to the minute, through the end of the monthly billing cycle.

EarthLink reserves the right to change any of the features, content or applications of the Service at any time with or without notice to you.

**6\. EMERGENCY SERVICES DIALING 911**

The Service supports E911 access to emergency services; however, there are important differences from traditional 911 services. You must give EarthLink the physical location where you will be using the Service for E911 service to function properly. You hereby acknowledge that registering your physical location where you will be using the Service is your responsibility.

Your 911 dialing feature (“EarthLink’s E911 Dialing”) may not be operational until you receive confirmation from EarthLink that your E911 has been activated.

EarthLink’s E911 Dialing will not function under any one of the following circumstances:

*   Before the Service is activated by EarthLink and notice is sent;
*   Service outages due to suspension or cancellation of your account; or
*   Changing your number or adding or porting new numbers to your account without successfully registering your location of use for each changed, newly added or newly ported phone number.

There may be a greater possibility of network congestion and/or reduced speed in the routing of an EarthLink E911 Dialing call made utilizing the Service as compared to traditional 911 dialing over traditional public telephone networks.

**7\. E911 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION**

EarthLink does not have any control over whether, or the manner in which, calls using EarthLink E911 Dialing are answered or addressed by any local emergency response center. EarthLink disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centers and the national emergency calling center. EarthLink disclaims any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route calls is incorrect or yields an erroneous result. Neither EarthLink nor its officers or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action, arising from or relating to EarthLink’s E911 Dialing unless such claims or causes of action arose from EarthLink’s gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless EarthLink, its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers and agents and any other service provider who furnishes services to you in connection with the Service, from any and all claims, losses, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys” fees) by, or on behalf of, you or any third party relating to the absence, failure or outage of the Service, including EarthLink’s E911 Dialing, incorrectly routed EarthLink’s E911 Dialing calls, and/or the inability of any user of the Service to be able to use EarthLink’s E911 Dialing or access emergency service personnel.

If you are not comfortable with the limitations of EarthLink’s E911 Dialing service, you should consider having an alternate means of accessing traditional 911 or other E911 services or canceling the Service.

**8\. SPECIFIC TERMS FOR THE EARTHLINK MODEM**

In the event that an EarthLink customer service representative confirms that your DSL Modem is not technically feasible, EarthLink will ship a new EarthLink Modem to you.

If you are unable to perform self-installation, EarthLink may suggest an outside vendor to help install the new EarthLink Modem. You will be responsible for all costs and scheduling associated with the installation by a third party. You are also responsible for all inside wiring repair necessary to install the service. If you are not the owner of the premises, you warrant that you have obtained the consent of the owner for vendor personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for installation. You will indemnify and hold EarthLink harmless from and against any claims of the owner of the premises arising out of the performance of this Agreement.

You are solely responsible for backing up all of your existing computer files and data. You assume responsibility for impacts to or loss of any warranty associated with the opening of your computer for installation purposes.

**9\. BILLING AND PAYMENT**

You are subscribing to the Service for the 12 Month Commitment period; and thereafter, the Service will be provided on a month to month basis until the Service is canceled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

If your billing plan is based on a monthly subscription fee, you agree to pay the recurring monthly fee in your billing plan due in advance of the month incurred. If your billing plan is based on usage, you will be billed each month based on usage. In addition, your bill will include (i) taxes, surcharges, and fees required by any applicable government entity; (ii) shipping and handling fees, if applicable; and (iii) method of payment charges, if applicable. Certain charges may not appear on the bill for the same period in which they were incurred.

If your billing plan is based on a monthly subscription fee, you will be billed a flat monthly fee. If your billing plan is based on usage, you will be billed each month based on usage. In addition, your bill will include (i) taxes, surcharges, and fees required by any applicable government entity and (ii) shipping and handling fees. All payments must be made in US dollars.

For monthly subscription billing plans, you will be able to use the Service for any consecutive monthly period that has been paid in advance as described in the acceptance materials that you received as part of you sales transaction or on your order confirmation. For example, if your billing cycle begins on the sixth day of the month, then your payment due date (i.e. the date that the amount of your full monthly Service fee, including any and all applicable taxes, must be received by EarthLink) will be on the fifth day of the next month and of each month thereafter.

Charges may be billed on or after your billing cycle date to your method of payment on file each month for the Service including any additional charges incurred (e.g. usage, taxes and fees). EarthLink is not responsible for any fees resulting from charges billed by EarthLink including, but not limited to, overdrawn accounts or exceeding credit card limits.

If you provided EarthLink with a valid credit or debit card, you agree to maintain valid and current credit or debit card information with EarthLink at all times. If you authorized EarthLink to automatically deduct (“**ACH Debit**“) your monthly Service fees and any other charges, fees, or taxes billed to you, from your checking or savings bank account, then you hereby reaffirm your agreement to the Recurring Automatic Bank Draft Authorization Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that you authorize EarthLink and that EarthLink does not need to obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options. In addition, if your credit or debit card company provides updated credit or debit card information to EarthLink, you acknowledge that EarthLink does not need to obtain authorization from you for EarthLink to use such information to update your credit or debit card.

If payment by check has been accepted by EarthLink, then payments by check must be received by EarthLink by the due date listed in your monthly paper invoice. EarthLink will charge a processing fee each time you pay your monthly billing invoice . When you pay your fees by check, you also authorize EarthLink to electronically process your payment. If your check is processed electronically, your checking account may be debited on the same day that EarthLink receives your check and neither your check nor a copy of your check will be included with your checking account statement. In addition to your monthly paper invoice, you may request that the monthly invoice also be sent to you via your Contact Email Address or if you designated a different billing email address , to such billing email address. EarthLink will charge you an account fee for each such paper invoice.

EarthLink will charge a fee for returned checks or returned bank drafts from your financial institution.

EarthLink will email an e-invoice to your primary EarthLink email address selected by or assigned to you during the subscription process (“Contact Email Address”) each month or if you designated a different billing email address, EarthLink will email the e-invoice to such billing email address each month. You may request through [https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing\_info.jsp](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing_info.jsp) or by calling EarthLink Customer Service that EarthLink mail a paper invoice to your billing mailing address each month. EarthLink will charge your account a fee for each paper invoice. If you elect to have EarthLink mail you your monthly invoice, you may request that EarthLink also email your monthly invoice your Contact Email Address or if you designated a different billing email address , to such billing email address. There is no charge for e-invoices.

Your account will be automatically inactivated if you put a stop payment on your account with your financial institution in connection with the payment of your monthly bill.

All charges are considered valid unless disputed in writing within 30 days of the billing date and mailed to1 :

> EarthLink, LLC  
> Customer Service  
> 1439 Peachtree Street NE  
> Atlanta, Georgia 30309

Adjustments will not be made for charges that are disputed more than 30 days after the billing date.

For fixed-location services for DSL, moving to another location will require the service to be re-provisioned at the new location. This may result in substantial interruption of the Service and will result in fees associated with cancellation and setting up a new account.

Delinquent accounts may be suspended or canceled at EarthLink’s sole discretion. If you pay your monthly Service fee to a third party provider, your account also may be suspended for non-payment if your account is delinquent. If your account is suspended, you may be charged reinstatement fees to reactivate your account.

In the event that you change to a different EarthLink service or change the speed of your existing Service, consult with an EarthLink representative how such change will affect your billing plan.

EarthLink reserves the right (i) to change the fees associated with your Service and institute new fees (e.g. equipment fees) upon email notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new fee to your Contact Email Address and (ii) to change the fees associated with your account upon email notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new fee to your Contact Email Address or your billing email address if different from your Contact Email address.

EarthLink may use various means to recover monies due. If EarthLink retains a collection agency or takes legal action to collect monies due on your account, you agree to pay all costs and expenses of collection incurred by EarthLink, which may include reasonable attorney’s fees and collection agency fees which may be based on a percentage of the amount owed, up to a maximum of 25%, where permitted by applicable law.

**10\. BILLING PLAN FEATURES (INCLUDING EMAIL STORAGE AND WEBSPACE)**

The billing plans for some of the Service may vary by geographic location, phone carrier and cable provider. In the event that you change to a different Service, prior to changing Service consult with an EarthLink representative regarding how such change will affect your billing plan.

The email storage limits for your billing plan are posted on the EarthLink website located at [www.earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net/). If your mailbox is approaching the storage limit for your Service, it will be noted visually on your web mail. EarthLink also will send email notices to this mailbox stating you are approaching your email storage limit. When your mailbox exceeds the allotted email storage space, you will receive a second email warning from EarthLink that your email storage is over quota and then EarthLink will stop transmitting email messages to your inbox. Any incoming emails will be bounced with an error message to the sender stating that your mailbox is full. After you delete some email messages to free up some space, new messages will be accepted again. You may purchase additional storage up to a fixed limit as described at [https://myaccount.earthlink.net](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/).

Certain billing plans may offer the ability to create your personal webspace. The maximum webspace available for such use is 10MB per email account. Limitations may include, but are not limited to, certain software and certain operating systems.  In the event that one of your personal webspace exceeds 10 MB, no additional information can be uploaded to it. If the traffic on one of your personal webspace exceeds 1 GB of webspace in a calendar month, such personal webspace will be shut down until the next calendar month. If you want more space or bandwidth for your personal webspace, you can subscribe to the EarthLink Web Hosting Service.

**11\. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION**

You may cancel your Service only as follows:

*   Telephone Cancellation: 1-888- 327-8454

Cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing cycle.

EarthLink will issue a confirmation number to you by email as proof of cancellation of your Service. Accounts are set to close at the end of the current billing period. EarthLink does not grant refunds or credits for any prior use including partial use during the last month prior to cancellation. Certain charges, such as 411 and international calling charges, will be billed after the account cancellation date.

If you cancel by one of the prescribed methods listed above and are mistakenly billed for your Service after the end of the billing period, EarthLink will refund any erroneous charges upon proof of such cancellation.

In the event that you port out (transfer) your existing phone number to another carrier and you do not contact EarthLink that you are cancelling your Service, EarthLink will use such port out date as the date of your cancellation of the Service.

If you move your Service or change your local telephone company and EarthLink can provide the Service at the new location or on the new telephone line, you must pay a reactivation fee because this change requires a new installation.

On the inactivation date of your Service, without further notice to you, your Service will be terminated and you will no longer have Internet access which includes access to your email, files or other information on EarthLink’s servers.

Cancellation of your account at any time will not excuse you from paying all accrued and unpaid charges due under this Agreement. After your account cancellation date, you also will be responsible for any unbilled charges, such as international calling and directory assistance charges.

EarthLink may terminate your account for the Service at any time for any reason, including, without limitation, if (i) your account is delinquent because charges on your method of payment were refused for any reason, (ii) you failed to make payment when due or you did not provide EarthLink with your credit or debit card’s expiration date or expiration date of any other method of payment before the existing expiration date; (iii) EarthLink, in its sole discretion, believes you have breached this Agreement or any other EarthLink agreements or policies; or (iv) your use of the Service is prohibited by law . A termination notice will be sent to you via (i) your Contact Email Address or (ii) U.S. Mail to the billing address for your EarthLink account. If your account for the Service is cancelled by EarthLink due to non-payment and then it is reactivated at a later date, EarthLink will bill you an account reactivation fee.

**12\. NUMBER TRANSFER ON SERVICE INACTIVATION**

Upon the inactivation date of your Service, EarthLink may, in its sole and absolute discretion, release to your new service provider the phone number that you ported (transferred or moved over) to EarthLink from your previous service provider and used in connection with your Service if:

*   Such new service provider is able to accept such number;
*   Your account has been properly canceled;
*   Your account is completely current, including payment for all charges and applicable termination fees; and
*   You request the transfer upon cancelling your account with EarthLink.

EarthLink’s number porting policies and procedures will be consistent with the applicable laws and regulations. If you want to keep your number, do NOT cancel the Service until you have made arrangements with another provider to transfer your number first.

**13\. USE OF THE SERVICE**

You represent that when you transmit, upload, post or submit any content, images or data using the Service you have the legal right to do so and that your use of such content, image or data does not violate any law (including copyright or trademark laws) or any other third party rights.

**19\. GOVERNING LAW**

This Agreement is governed by Georgia law without regard to conflict of law provisions.

**20\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS)**

20.1 Summary

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-EARTHLINK. If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.

20.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
*   Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “EarthLink,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Services under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

20.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration

20.3(1) Notice of Dispute

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you.

20.3(2) Settlement Proposals

The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.

20.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution

If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.

20.4 Commencement of Arbitration

You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address. You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, https://www.adr.org. If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.)

20.5 Arbitration Procedures

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

20.6 Appeal

If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within 30 days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA. If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.

20.7 Arbitration Fees

Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

20.8 Awards and Attorney’s Fees

If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the awardor $2,500 (“Alternative Payment”), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney’s fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (“Attorney Fee Award”).

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in this Section 20.8 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses. Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.

20.9 Waiver of Class Actions; Limits of Scope of Arbitrator’s Authority

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.

20.10 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 20 of this Version dated September 15, 2016.

**21\. REVISIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT**

EarthLink may revise, amend, or modify this Agreement at any time by posting the revised version of this Agreement on the EarthLink Web Site located at [www.earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net/). The revised version will be effective on the date that it is posted as stated at the end of the revised version. The material changes to this Agreement will be noted in endnotes of the revised version.

**22\. MISCELLANEOUS**

You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired thereby. The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 20; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court. EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision. Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent. EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.

Effective Date: September 30, 2017

The following endnote summarizes the material revision made in this September 30, 2017 version of this Agreement compared to the September 15, 2016 version of this Agreement.

1 EarthLink address changes throughout the Agreement.

READ THIS AGREEMENT BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE EARTHLINK EMAIL BETA PROGRAM.

This Email Beta Program Service Agreement (“Agreement”) is between EarthLink, LLC and its related entities (“EarthLink”) and you as a participant in the EarthLink Email Beta Program and governs your participation in the EarthLink Email Beta Program (“Beta Program”). This Agreement consists of the terms and conditions below.

By signing up or using the Beta Program, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and to use the Beta Program in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

**1\. THE BETA PROGRAM**

The Beta Program is a trial environment for EarthLink to test new code for email features and functionalities. EarthLink provides EarthLink subscribers who participate in the Beta Program with 1 gigabyte of email storage in consideration for their participation in the Beta Program. The standard EarthLink email accounts have 100 megabytes. Participation in the Beta Program is by invitation only. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate in the Beta Program.

The effective date of this Agreement commences when you agree to participate in the Beta Program and continues until the termination of your participation in the Beta Program. During the period that you participate in the Beta Program, you will continue to pay your monthly fees for your EarthLink access service to EarthLink.

Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 will survive the termination of this Agreement.

**2\. FEEDBACK**

You can provide comments and suggestions about the Beta Program by clicking on the “Feedback” link in your email inbox. EarthLink will own the rights to any information that you give us as part of the Beta Program and some of the information that you provide to EarthLink may become public information.

**3\. CANCELLATION OF THE BETA PROGRAM**

You may cancel your participation in the Beta Program through [https://www.earthlink.net/offers/mailtrial/unjoin](https://www.earthlink.net/offers/mailtrial/unjoin) . Please note that you will not be allowed to cancel the Beta Program until you modify your email account so that it does not take advantage of the Beta Program’s expanded email storage. For example, because the Beta Program email account has a 1 gigabyte email box and a standard account has a 100 megabyte email box, you cannot cancel your participation in the Beta Program until you trim your email box back down to 100 megabytes or less.

EarthLink may modify, suspend or discontinue or cancel your participation in the Beta Program at any time for any reason. If EarthLink cancels your participation in the Beta Program, a termination notice will be sent to you via (i) email to the primary EarthLink email address selected by or assigned to you during the registration process (“Contact Email Address”) or (ii) U.S. Mail to the mailing address on file.

**4\. GENERAL DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES**

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY TO THE ACTS, OMISSIONS, NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE EARTHLINK PARTIES WHICH, BUT FOR THIS PROVISION, WOULD GIVE RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ANY EARTHLINK PARTY IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL DOCTRINE.

**7\. GOVERNING LAW**

This Agreement is governed by Georgia law without regard to conflict of law provisions.

8\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS)

8.1 Summary

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-EARTHLINK. If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.

8.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
*   Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “EarthLink,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Beta Program under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action . This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

8.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration

8.3(1) Notice of Dispute

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you.

8.3(2) Settlement Proposals

The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.

8.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution

If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.

8.4 Commencement of Arbitration

You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address. You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, https://www.adr.org. If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.)

8.5 Arbitration Procedures

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

8.6 Appeal

If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA. If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.

8.7 Arbitration Fees

Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

8.8 Awards and Attorney’s Fees

If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the awardor $2,500 (“Alternative Payment”), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney’s fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (“Attorney Fee Award”).

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in this Section 8.8 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses. Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.

8.9 Waiver of Class Actions; Limits of Scope of Arbitrator’s Authority

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.

8.10 Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 8 of this Version dated September 15, 2016.

You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void.

The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 8; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court. EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision. Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent. EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.

The charges for the Service can be found at [www.earthlink.net/software/stayconnected.faces?tab=homenetworking&p=start](https://www.earthlink.net/software/stayconnected.faces?tab=homenetworking&p=start). You agree to pay the recurring monthly fee in your billing plan due in advance of the month incurred. In addition, your bill will include (i) taxes, surcharges, and fees required by any applicable government entity; (ii) shipping and handling fees, if applicable; and (iii) method of payment fees, if applicable. All payments must be made in US dollars.

You will be able to use the Service for any consecutive monthly period that has been paid in advance as described in the acceptance materials that you received as part of you sales transaction or on your order confirmation. For example, if your billing cycle begins on the sixth day of the month, then your payment due date (i.e. the date that the amount of your full monthly Service fee, including any and all applicable taxes, must be received by EarthLink) will be on the fifth day of the next month and of each month thereafter. If you subscribe to an EarthLink broadband access service, the Service fees are in addition to your monthly access fee. EarthLink may charge for shipping, taxes, billing fees, postage and handling and other applicable fees.

Charges may be billed on or after your billing cycle date to your method of payment on file each month for the Service including any additional charges incurred (taxes and fees). EarthLink is not responsible for any fees resulting from charges billed by EarthLink including, but not limited to, overdrawn accounts or exceeding credit or debit card limits.

If you provided EarthLink with a valid credit or debit card, you agree to maintain valid and current credit or debit card information with EarthLink at all times. If you authorized EarthLink to automatically deduct (“**ACH Debit**“) your monthly Service fees and any other charges, fees, or taxes billed to you, from your checking or savings bank account, then you hereby reaffirm your agreement to the Recurring Automatic Bank Draft Authorization Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that you authorize EarthLink and that EarthLink does not need to obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options. In addition, if your credit or debit card company provides updated credit or debit card information to EarthLink, you acknowledge that EarthLink does not need to obtain authorization from you for EarthLink to use such information to update your credit or debit card.

If payment by check has been accepted by EarthLink, then payments by check must be received by EarthLink by the due date listed in your monthly paper invoice. EarthLink will charge a processing fee each time you pay your monthly billing invoice . When you pay your fees by check, you also authorize EarthLink to electronically process your payment. If your check is processed electronically, your checking account may be debited on the same day that EarthLink receives your check and neither your check nor a copy of your check will be included with your checking account statement.

EarthLink will charge a fee for returned checks or returned bank drafts from your financial institution.

EarthLink will email an e-invoice to your primary EarthLink email address selected by or assigned to you during the subscription process (“Contact Email Address”) each month or if you designated a different billing email address, EarthLink will email the e-invoice to such billing email address each month. You may request through [https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing\_info.jsp](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing_info.jsp) or by calling EarthLink Customer Service that EarthLink mail a paper invoice to your billing mailing address each month. EarthLink will charge your account a fee for each paper invoice. If you elect to have EarthLink mail you your monthly invoice, you may request that EarthLink also email your monthly invoice your Contact Email Address or if you designated a different billing email address , to such billing email address. There is no charge for e-invoices.

Your account will be automatically inactivated if you put a stop payment on your account with your financial institution in connection with the payment of your monthly bill.

Such written notice may include a letter sent via U.S. mail, a notice on your monthly bill or an email sent to your Contact Email Address.

EarthLink may use various means to recover monies due. If EarthLink retains a collection agency or takes legal action to collect monies due on your account, you agree to pay all costs and expenses of collection incurred by EarthLink, which may include reasonable attorney’s fees and collection agency fees which may be based on a percentage of the amount owed, up to a maximum of 25%, where permitted by applicable law.

In certain situations, EarthLink may waive the early termination fee, at its discretion, if (i) EarthLink no longer provides the Service to your current location, (ii) you live in an area currently deemed a weather or war disaster area, or (iii) you were deployed for active military service.

The Service will close at the end of the current billing period in which notice of cancellation is received or in which EarthLink canceled your Service.

If you ordered EarthLink-provided equipment, EarthLink requires that you pay any past due balance with EarthLink prior to EarthLink shipping the EarthLink-provided equipment.

**8\. EARTHLINK-PROVIDED EQUIPMENT RETURN POLICY**

If you purchased EarthLink-provided Equipment, the following applies: All EarthLink-provided Equipment returns must have an EarthLink-provided shipping label and the original packaging (or equivalent).

EarthLink will not accept the return of EarthLink-provided Equipment without EarthLink Technical Support Department certification and shipping label after 30 days from the original shipping date. EarthLink will not replace any EarthLink-provided Equipment, including replacements, after one year from your original shipping date.

**14\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS)**

14.1 Summary

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-EARTHLINK. If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court .

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.

14.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
*   Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “EarthLink,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Services under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

14.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration

14.3(1) Notice of Dispute

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you.

14.3(2) Settlement Proposals

The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.

14.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution

If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.

14.4 Commencement of Arbitration

You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address. You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, https://www.adr.org. If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.)

14.5 Arbitration Procedures

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at http://www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

14.6 Appeal

If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within 30 days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA. If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.

14.7 Arbitration Fees

Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

14.8 Awards and Attorney’s Fees

If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the awardor $2,500 (“Alternative Payment”), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney’s fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (“Attorney Fee Award”).

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in this Section 14.8 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses. Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.

14.9 Waiver of Class Actions; Limits of Scope of Arbitrator’s Authority

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.

14.10 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 14 of this Version dated September 15, 2016.

The revised version will be effective on the date that it is posted as stated at the end of the revised version.

**16\. MISCELLANEOUS**

You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired thereby. The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 14; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court. EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision. Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent. EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.

You will not be able to restore files that EarthLink has not completed copying or files that have been changed but not yet been backed up or not eligible for backup.

If your account for the Service expires, is terminated, is not renewed, or is otherwise discontinued for any reason, EarthLink and its providers may, without notice, delete or deny you access to any of your backup data that may remain in their possession or control.

You agree that if you mark a file to no longer be backed up, delete a file from your computer, or terminate or allow your trial or license to terminate, non-renew, or otherwise lapse for any reason, that these files may not be available to you should you wish to restore them.

You agree that EarthLink and its providers may retain (but will have no obligation to retain) your backup data for a period after your trial or license has been terminated, expired, or otherwise lapsed, as part of EarthLink’s marketing to you the opportunity to purchase, renew, or extend a license.

**8\. PROVISIONING, BILLING AND PAYMENT**

You agree to pay the monthly fees in your billing plan for the Service (“Fees”) and to pay any applicable taxes. All payments must be made in US dollars.

You will be able to use the Service for any consecutive monthly period that has been paid in advance as described in the acceptance materials that you received as part of you sales transaction or on your order confirmation. For example, if your billing cycle begins on the sixth day of the month, then your payment due date (i.e. the date that the amount of your full monthly Service fee, including any and all applicable taxes, must be received by EarthLink) will be on the fifth day of the next month and of each month thereafter.

Charges may be billed on or after your billing cycle date to your method of payment on file each month for the Service including any additional charges incurred (e.g. usage, taxes and fees). EarthLink is not responsible for any fees resulting from charges billed by EarthLink including, but not limited to, overdrawn accounts or exceeding credit card limits.

If you provided EarthLink with a valid credit or debit card, you agree to maintain valid and current credit or debit card information with EarthLink at all times. If you authorized EarthLink to automatically deduct (“**ACH Debit**“) your monthly Service fees and any other charges, fees, or taxes billed to you, from your checking or savings bank account, then you hereby reaffirm your agreement to the [Recurring Automatic Bank Draft Authorization Agreement](https://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/ach-signup-auth.faces) . You acknowledge and agree that you authorize EarthLink and that EarthLink does not need to obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options. In addition, if your credit or debit card company provides updated credit or debit card information to EarthLink, you acknowledge that EarthLink does not need to obtain authorization from you for EarthLink to use such information to update your credit or debit card.

If payment by check has been accepted by EarthLink, then payments by check must be received by EarthLink by the due date listed in your monthly paper invoice. EarthLink will charge a processing fee each time you pay your monthly billing invoice. When you pay your fees by check, you also authorize EarthLink to electronically process your payment. If your check is processed electronically, your checking account may be debited on the same day that EarthLink receives your check and neither your check nor a copy of your check will be included with your checking account statement. In addition to your monthly paper invoice, you may request that the monthly invoice also be sent to you via your Contact Email Address or if you designated a different billing email address, to such billing email address. EarthLink will charge you an account fee for each such paper invoice.

EarthLink will charge a fee for returned checks or returned bank drafts from your financial institution.

EarthLink will email an e-invoice to your primary EarthLink or PeoplePC email address selected by or assigned to you during the subscription process (“Contact Email Address”) each month or if you designated a different billing email address, EarthLink will email the e-invoice to such billing email address each month. You may request through [https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing\_info.jsp](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing_info.jsp) or by calling EarthLink Customer Service that EarthLink mail a paper invoice to your billing mailing address each month. EarthLink will charge your account a fee for each paper invoice. If you elect to have EarthLink mail you your monthly invoice, you may request that EarthLink also email your monthly invoice your Contact Email Address or if you designated a different billing email address , to such billing email address. There is no charge for e-invoices.

Your account will be automatically inactivated if you put a stop payment on your account with your financial institution in connection with the payment of your monthly bill.

All charges are considered valid unless disputed in writing within 30 days of the billing date and mailed to1:

> EarthLink, LLC  
> Customer Service  
> 1439 Peachtree Street NE  
> Atlanta, Georgia 30309

Adjustments will not be made for charges that are disputed more than 30 days after the billing date.

EarthLink reserves the right (i) to change the fees associated with your Service and institute new fees upon email notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new fee to your Contact Email Address and (ii) to change the fees associated with your account upon email notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new fee to your Contact Email Address or your billing email address if different from your Contact Email address.

EarthLink may use various means to recover monies due. If EarthLink retains a collection agency or takes legal action to collect monies due on your account, you agree to pay all costs and expenses of collection incurred by EarthLink, which may include reasonable attorney’s fees and collection agency fees which may be based on a percentage of the amount owed, up to a maximum of 25%, where permitted by applicable law.

**9\. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION**

You may cancel your Service only as follows:

EarthLink may terminate your account for the Service at any time for any reason, including, without limitation, if (i) your account is delinquent because charges on your method of payment were refused for any reason, (ii) you failed to make payment when due or you did not provide EarthLink with your credit or debit card’s expiration date or expiration date of any other method of payment before the existing expiration date; (iii) EarthLink, in its sole discretion, believes you have breached this Agreement or any other EarthLink agreements or policies; or (iv) your use of the Service is prohibited by law. A termination notice will be sent to you via (i) your Contact Email Address or (ii) U.S. Mail to the billing address for your EarthLink account. On the inactivation date of your Service, without further notice to you, your Service will be terminated.

Upon expiration or termination, you will immediately cease all use of the Service and any documentation. Termination is not an exclusive remedy and all other remedies will be available whether or not the license is terminated.

**14\. GOVERNING LAW**

**15\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS)**

15.1 Summary

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-EARTHLINK. If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.

15.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
*   Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “EarthLink,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Service under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

15.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration

15.3(1) Notice of Dispute

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you. s

15.3(2) Settlement Proposals

The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.

15.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution

If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.

15.4 Commencement of Arbitration

You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address. You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, https://www.adr.org. If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.)

15.5 Arbitration Procedures

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

15.6 Appeal

If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within 30 days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA. If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.

15.7 Arbitration Fees

Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

15.8 Awards and Attorney’s Fees

If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (“Alternative Payment”), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney’s fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (“Attorney Fee Award”).

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in this Section 18.8 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses. Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.

15.9 Waiver of Class Actions; Limits of Scope of Arbitrator’s Authority

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.

15.10 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 15 of this Version dated September 15, 2016.

**16\. REVISIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT**

EarthLink may revise, amend, or modify this Agreement at any time by posting the revised version of this Agreement on the EarthLink Web Site located at [www.earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net/) which is also linked from www.peoplepc.com. The revised version will be effective on the date that it is posted as stated at the end of the revised version.

**17\. MISCELLANEOUS**

You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired thereby. The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 15; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court. EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision.

EarthLink does not grant refunds or credits for any prior use including partial use during the last month prior to cancellation.

**14\. GOVERNING LAW**

**15\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS)**

15.1 Summary

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-EARTHLINK. If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted . For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.

15.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
*   Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “EarthLink,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Services under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

15.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration

15.3(1) Notice of Dispute

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) (“Notic e Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you.

15.3(2) Settlement Proposals

The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.

15.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution

If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.

15.4 Commencement of Arbitration

You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address. You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, www.adr.org. If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.)

15.5 Arbitration Procedures

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

15.6 Appeal

If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within 30 days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA. If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.

15.7 Arbitration Fees

Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

15.8 Awards and Attorney’s Fees

If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (“Alternative Payment”), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney’s fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (“Attorney Fee Award”).

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in this Section 15.8 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses. Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.

15.9 Waiver of Class Actions; Limits of Scope of Arbitrator’s Authority

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.

15.10 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 15 of this Version dated September 15, 2016.

The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 15; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court. EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision. Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent. EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.

EarthLink will send you a welcome email as written confirmation of your order. EarthLink may accept or reject any potential subscriber to the Services in its sole discretion.

**5\. BILLING AND PAYMENT**

You agree to pay (i) the recurring monthly fees in your billing plan due in advance of the month incurred or the one-time prepaid fee for the fixed period set forth in your prepaid billing plan, whichever is applicable; (ii) any applicable set-up fees; and (iii) any applicable method of payment fees. Also, you will be responsible for paying all taxes, surcharges, and fees required by any applicable government entity including taxes in connection with any purchases made from your website. All payments will be made in US dollars.

You must provide accurate billing information including legal name, address, telephone number, and credit or debit card number and expiration date and report all changes to this information promptly to EarthLink.

Charges may be billed on or after your billing cycle date to your method of payment on file each month for the Services including any additional charges incurred (e.g. usage, taxes and fees). EarthLink is not responsible for any fees resulting from charges billed by EarthLink including, but not limited to, overdrawn accounts or exceeding credit card limits.

For monthly subscription billing plans, you will be able to use the Services for any consecutive monthly period that has been paid in advance as described in the acceptance materials that you received as part of you sales transaction or on your order confirmation. For example, if your billing cycle begins on the sixth day of the month, then your payment due date (i.e. the date that the amount of your full monthly Service fee, including any and all applicable taxes, must be received by EarthLink) will be on the fifth day of the next month and of each month thereafter.

If you provided EarthLink with a valid credit or debit card, you agree to maintain valid and current credit or debit card information with EarthLink at all times. If you authorized EarthLink to automatically deduct (“ACH Debit”) your monthly Service fees and any other charges, fees, or taxes billed to you, from your checking or savings bank account, then you hereby reaffirm your agreement to the [Recurring Automatic Bank Draft Authorization Agreement](https://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/ach-signup-auth.faces). You acknowledge and agree that you authorize EarthLink and that EarthLink does not need to obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options. In addition, if your credit or debit card company provides updated credit or debit card information to EarthLink, you acknowledge that EarthLink does not need to obtain authorization from you for EarthLink to use such information to update your credit or debit card.

If payment by check has been accepted by EarthLink, then payments by check must be received by EarthLink by the due date listed in your monthly paper invoice. EarthLink will charge a processing fee each time you pay your monthly billing invoice. When you pay your fees by check, you also authorize EarthLink to electronically process your payment. If your check is processed electronically, your checking account may be debited on the same day that EarthLink receives your check and neither your check nor a copy of your check will be included with your checking account statement.

EarthLink will charge a fee for returned checks or returned bank drafts from your financial institution.

EarthLink will email an e-invoice to your primary EarthLink email address selected by or assigned to you during the subscription process (“Contact Email Address”) each month or if you designated a different billing email address, EarthLink will email the e-invoice to such billing email address each month. You may request through [https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing\_info.jsp](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/cam/billing_info.jsp) or by calling EarthLink Customer Service that EarthLink mail a paper invoice to your billing mailing address each month. EarthLink will charge your account a fee for each paper invoice. If you elect to have EarthLink mail you your monthly invoice, you may request that EarthLink also email your monthly invoice your Contact Email Address or if you designated a different billing email address, to such billing email address. There is no charge for e-invoices.

Delinquent accounts may be suspended or canceled at EarthLink’s sole discretion; however charges will continue to accrue until the account is canceled. If you pay your monthly Service fee to a third party provider, your account also may be suspended for non-payment if your account is delinquent.

Your account will be automatically inactivated if you put a stop payment on your account with your financial institution in connection with the payment of your monthly bill.

If you have a prepaid billing plan, EarthLink will automatically renew your prepaid billing plan on the prepaid billing plan anniversary date unless your Service is canceled or you change to the monthly billing plan. If you have the monthly billing plan, EarthLink will charge you the monthly fee each month until your Service is canceled or you change to the prepaid billing plan.

All charges are considered valid unless disputed in writing within thirty (30) days of the billing date and mailed to 1:

> EarthLink, LLC
> 
> Customer Service
> 
> 1439 Peachtree Street NE
> 
> Atlanta, Georgia 30309

Adjustments will not be made for charges that are disputed more than thirty (30) days after the billing date.

If you upgrade from the Design Your Own to the Professional Design Service, there will not be any cost for upgrading except for the difference in the monthly fees. If you downgrade from the Professional Design Service to the Design Your Own prior to the end of your 12 month term, you will be charged the applicable early termination fee. However, if you downgrade from the Professional Design Service to the Design Your Own after the 12 month term, you will not be charged the early termination fee. Such upgrade or downgrade will take effect immediately and the new monthly fee will take effect as of the date of such change.

If you change from your existing plan within the Design Your Own to another plan within the Design Your Own (e.g. Website Plus to Business Website Plus), there will not be any cost for this change except the difference in the monthly fees. If you change from your existing plan within the Professional Design Service to another plan within the Professional Design Service (e.g. Premium Design and Marketing Website to Standard Design and Marketing Website) prior to the 12 month term, you will be charged the early termination fee. But if you change from your existing plan within the Professional Design Service to another plan within the Professional Design Service after the 12 month term, you will not be charged the early termination fee. The new plan will start immediately and the new monthly will take effect as of the date of such change.

EarthLink reserves the right (i) to change the fees associated with your Services and institute new fees upon email notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new monthly fee to your Contact Email Address and (ii) to change the fees associated with your account upon email notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new fee to your Contact Email Address or your billing email address if different from your Contact Email address.

EarthLink may use various means to recover monies due. If EarthLink retains a collection agency or takes legal action to collect monies due on your account, you agree to pay all costs and expenses of collection incurred by EarthLink, which may include reasonable attorney’s fees and collection agency fees which may be based on a percentage of the amount owed, up to a maximum of 25%, where permitted by applicable law.

If you cancel by one of the prescribed methods listed above and are mistakenly billed for your Services after the end of the billing period, EarthLink will refund any erroneous charges upon proof of such cancellation.

The Professional Design Service’s monthly payment billing plan has a twelve (12) month commitment. If you cancel the Professional Design Service prior to completing the twelve (12) payments, EarthLink will bill you for the remaining unpaid monthly payments.

For thirty (30) days after the first draft of the Created Website is posted, you can work with the EarthLink Website Expert to make up to three (3) minor changes to the Created Website to finalize it for deployment.

In the event that you have a site posted on your domain name’s URL, the Limited Website Design will remain in your Project Center for as long as your account remains active on the Professional Design Services.

After your review of such Limited Website Design, you may select a different template if necessary. After the EarthLink Website Expert receives your feedback regarding your selected template and all the content you want on your website, the EarthLink Website Expert will rebuild your website. Such rebuilt website will be considered your Created Website. After the new website design is completed, the EarthLink Website Expert will send you an email informing you that the new website design has been posted in your Project Center for your review.

You will use the Created Website or the Limited Website Design, as applicable, as one website only, displayed at a single IP address, with the exception that you may create one duplicate of the Created Website or Limited Website Design for back-up purposes.

In addition to your indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold the EarthLink Parties harmless from and against all third party claims, demands, suits, actions, judgments, losses, costs, damages (including, but not limited to, direct, indirect and consequential), attorney’s fees and expenses that an EarthLink Party may sustain or incur in connection with the Additional Content on Your Website.

12.7 Data Transfer and Storage Limits

Your EarthLink Web Hosting Service plan sets forth your monthly data transfer and storage limits. The EarthLink Web Hosting Control Center provides you with usage data on your bandwidth (data transfer) and disk space (storage). EarthLink will send you a warning message email that your monthly data transfer is approaching its limit and you will be charged overage fees if your monthly data transfer exceeds its limit. If your website reaches its monthly storage limit, you will not be able to upload additional documents. In such event you can delete some of the stored documents or upgrade to an EarthLink Web Hosting Service plan with a higher monthly storage limit.

12.8 Restrictions of Use

You will not attempt to undermine the security or integrity of the EarthLink Web Hosting Service or the EarthLink network including, but not limited to, port scanning, vulnerability probing or denial of service attacks of any kind. In addition, running excessively CPU intensive CGIs such as IRC bots and utilities, Bit Torrent clients, and any application that acts as a server and listens for inbound network connections are prohibited. Software that acts as proxy server/scripts also is not permitted. If your processes are adversely affecting server or network performance, EarthLink reserves the right to terminate and disable the offending processes even if such action causes disruption to your website. EarthLink restricts run time of any customer’s CGI process to five minutes.

Using the EarthLink Web Hosting Service to send unsolicited bulk emails or usenet postings (spam) is also prohibited. Engaging in activities pertaining to Black Hat SEO, spandexing and so-called “scraper sites” is prohibited. EarthLink reserves the right to disable any portion of your website if EarthLink determines, at its sole discretion, that your website is being used for spamming, hacking or any other type of illegal activity.

**13\. SECTION 13 APPLIES ONLY TO THE EARTHLINK DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICE**

13.1 ICANN

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) develops and implements policies regarding the registration and renewals of domain names (“ICANN RULES”). Only ICANN accredited registrars can register and renew domain names. EarthLink provides the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service through the domain registrar services provided by OpenSRS (“Registrar”) which is an ICANN accredited registrar, and as such you agree that EarthLink is limited to providing the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service in accordance with the terms located at [https://www.opensrs.com/wp-content/uploads/Master\_Services\_Agreement.pdf](https://www.opensrs.com/wp-content/uploads/Master_Services_Agreement.pdf). Registrar and EarthLink are bound by the ICANN Rules. EarthLink may modify this Agreement in order to comply with changes or updates to the ICANN rules.

Under the ICANN Rules, you have the (i) rights and responsibilities set forth on the ICANN webpage located at [http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/educational](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/educational) and (ii) benefits and additional responsibilities set forth on the ICANN webpage located at [http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits).

The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “UDRP”), as amended from time to time, has been adopted by ICANN and is hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement and can be found at [http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm](http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm). The UDRP sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you and any party other than EarthLink or Registrar over the registration and use of a domain name registered by you. UDRP has been adopted by all ICANN-accredited registrars.

13.2 How to Register Your Domain Name

You acknowledge and agree that EarthLink does not guarantee that you will be able to register or renew a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that domain name is available, because EarthLink cannot know with certainty whether or not the domain name which you are seeking to register is simultaneously being sought by a third party, or whether there are any inaccuracies or errors in the domain name registration or related databases, including the various WhoIs databases.

You further acknowledge and agree that EarthLink may elect to accept or reject your application for registration for any reason at its sole discretion, such rejection including, but not limited to, rejection due to a request for registration of a prohibited domain name. You also acknowledge and agree that EarthLink is not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by Registrar arising out of or related to your application for, registration of, renewal of, or failure to register or renew a particular domain name.

13.3 Registration Requirements for TLDs

EarthLink registers and manages the following top level domains (TLDs) for new customers: .com, .net, .org, .biz, .asia, .club, .info, .mobi, .name, .tel, .us and .cc.

There are no restrictions on who may register the following: .com, .net, .info, .tel and .cc.

The .org TLD and the .club TLD are restricted to groups, organizations, assemblies, and communities.

The .name TLD is the only global TLD authorized by ICANN exclusively for private individuals.

The .asia TLD is restricted to companies, organizations, and individuals based in the region of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.

If you are registering the .biz TLD, you agree that as of the date your register you domain, your registered domain will be used primarily for a bona fide business or commercial purpose. A bona fide business purpose is one of the following: (i) to exchange goods, services, or property of any kind in the ordinary course of trade or business; or (ii) to facilitate the exchange of goods, services, information, or property of any kind in the ordinary course of trade or business. You also agree that the .biz TLD will not be used exclusively for personal use; or solely for the purposes of (i) selling, trading or leasing the domain for compensation, or (ii) the unsolicited offering to sell, trade or lease the domain for compensation.

More detailed information about the registration requirements of the above TLDs can be found at [http://opensrs.com/site/resources/agreements](http://opensrs.com/site/resources/agreements).

Your domain name application process will not be effective until the domain name registration information you provide to EarthLink is delivered to Registrar and Registrar puts into effect your domain name registration.

13.4 WhoIs Information

You are required by ICANN, Registrar and EarthLink to provide the following contact information for each of your domain name registrations (“WhoIs Information”):

*   _Registrant Contact_ is the official owner of and highest authority for a domain name. Usually the registrant is the same as the Administrative Contact, though in some circumstances, the registrant may designate another individual to be responsible for the maintenance of the domain name.
*   _Administrative Contact_ manages the domain name and has full authority to request and authorize any decisions and updates to the domain name. If the administrative contact is not the owner of the domain name, he or she is the representative of the owner.
*   _Technical Contact_ is the person, role, or organization responsible for the web server on which a domain is hosted. The technical contact has the authority to update name server information, and attend to the technical administration of the domain files on the server but does not have the authority to transfer ownership or administrative rights.

*   _Billing Contact_ is the party responsible for receiving and paying the registration and renewal fees.

For each of the categories listed above, you are required by ICANN to provide (i) first name, (ii) last name, (iii) company or organization, if applicable, (iv) street address, (v) city/state/country, (vi) zip code, (vii) email address and (viii) telephone number. ICANN also requires you to update your WhoIs Information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate. EarthLink will provide your WhoIs Information to Registrar to process the registration or renewal of your domain name. You acknowledge that Registrar may use certain of your WhoIs Information provided by EarthLink regarding your domain name registration or renewal in a manner consistent with Registrar’s Domain Name Registration Agreements .

As required by ICANN, your WhoIs Information will be publicly available and accessible through a domain name search unless you choose to pay for EarthLink’s domain contact privacy service which masks the identity of the registrant on the public WhoIs directory. If you subscribe to EarthLink’s domain name privacy service, the WhoIs Information associated with your domain name on the public WhoIs directory will appear as Contact Privacy, Inc. with the address and telephone number of the Registrar and a proxy email address. Emails sent to the proxy address will automatically be forwarded to your Registrant Contact email address without revealing it to the public.

You hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from disclosure of the WhoIs information provided by you to EarthLink.

Each year ICANN requires registrars to remind registrants to review the registrant’s WhoIs Information for the registrant’s domain. Upon receipt of this reminder email from Registrar, you will not need to take any action if all of your WhoIs Information is correct but if any of your WhoIs Information is inaccurate, you will need to correct it by contacting EarthLink by telephone or using the EarthLink Control Center. If this annual email from Registrar bounces back, the “WhoIs Accuracy Program” verification process will be triggered and you will receive an email from Registrar asking you to verify your email address within 15 calendar days by clicking on the link in the email. If you do not verify your email address within such 15 day period, the DNS to your domain will be redirected to point to the Registrar’s servers and your website will not be displayed on the Internet until the verification process has been completed.

13.5 Renewal

Unless EarthLink receives alternate instructions from you at least two (2) months prior to the domain name renewal date, EarthLink will automatically bill you for your domain name renewal at the then-current renewal fee on your monthly billing date two months prior to the domain name renewal date. EarthLink will use your method of payment on file.

EarthLink will renew your domain name registration on the domain name renewal date for the same period of time as the period of time of your original registration term provided that your renewal fees have been paid. For example, if your original registration term was one year, then EarthLink will renew your domain name registration for a one year renewal term.

EarthLink is not responsible for any domain name for which you chose not to renew its registration. In the event that you have not paid your EarthLink Web Hosting fees or domain name registration fees, as applicable, or your EarthLink account has gone into suspended or inactive status or is otherwise not in good standing, EarthLink will not renew your domain name. If your EarthLink account is brought back to active and in good standing status after the registration of your domain name has expired, EarthLink will not be responsible for renewing the expired domain name registration.

Registrar allows a grace period for registrants to renew expired domain names after the actual expiration date. The number of days in the grace period varies by domain name extensions. After the grace period expires, Registrar will place your expired domain name into redemption status for a certain period of time which would allow you to reclaim your domain name and renew it s registration upon payment of a redemption fee in addition to the renewal fee. Before the domain name expires, attempts will be made to email the Registrant Contact email address.

If your domain name is not renewed during the grace period or the redemption period, it will be released to the general public. After your domain name is released to the general public by the Registrar because it was not renewed, EarthLink will no longer be able to purchase or manage your domain name. EarthLink then will remove your domain name from EarthLink’s domain management system.

13.6 The Customer Relationship

By submitting the domain name registration application to EarthLink, you acknowledge and agree that you are a customer of EarthLink for purposes of EarthLink registering and renewing your domain name.

After EarthLink sends your new registration to Registrar, Registrar will send you an email that will ask you to verify your email address within 15 calendar days by clicking on the confirmation link and following the verification steps. Registrar will consider your domain name registration verified after you completed the verification steps. If you do not verify your email address within such 15 calendar day period, the DNS for your domain may be updated to point to the Registrar’s servers and your website will not resolve which means that your website will not be displayed on the Internet until the verification is completed. In such case, you should call EarthLink to send you a new verification email. After you verify your email address, the DNS will point to your domain and your website will be displayed.

Upon termination of EarthLink’s relationship with Registrar or during the renewal of your domain name registration, EarthLink, in its sole discretion, may transfer your domain name registration to a new registrar at no additional charge to you and that this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. In the event that the registrar transfer process requires changing your administrative contact information and/or your organization’s contact information to EarthLink, to expedite such transfer process, EarthLink will notify you that your administrative contact information and/or your organization’s contact information will be changed to EarthLink for the short period of time while your domain name registration is transferred to the new registrar. Changing this information to EarthLink during the transfer process will not affect your ownership of the domain. After the transfer of your domain name to the new registrar has been completed, EarthLink and the new registrar will change the transferred administrative contact information and/or your organization’s contact information back to your original administrative contact information and/or your original organization’s contact information. The new registrar will contact you via email with a confirmation link for you to verify the domain transfer from Registrar to the new registrar. If you do not verify this domain transfer to the new registrar within such 15 calendar day period, the DNS for your domain may be updated to point to the Registrar’s servers and your website will not resolve which means that your website will not show up on the Internet until the verification is completed. In such case, you must call EarthLink to request that we send you a new verification email. After you verify your email address, the DNS will be repointed to your domain.

If you decide to transfer the registration of your domain name that has been recently renewed through the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service to another domain name registration reseller or directly with another registrar, there is the potential that the renewal year will be lost.

13.7 Approval Process for Your Changes to your WhoIs Information

ICANN has instituted a new transfer policy effective December 1, 2016 (“ICANN Transfer Policy”) which covers the approval procedures for (i) updates to any of the following fields in a registrant’s WhoIs Information: first name, last name, organization or email address or (ii) changing ownership of the domain name from the current registrant to another registrant (“New Registrant”). Such changes are collectively referred to as “Changes”.

If you are the current registrant of a domain registered through the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service, you will receive an email directly from the Registrar asking you to confirm the Changes. During the confirmation process you will have the option to check a box to “waive the 60-day transfer lock”. Under the ICANN Transfer Policy, if you do not check this box, your domain will be locked for 60 days and the domain registration cannot be transferred to another registrar during the 60 day period.

The ICANN Transfer Policy allows new registrants to delegate their consent to the Changes to a third party as a designated agent (“Designated Agent”) to confirm the Changes . If you are the new registrant of a domain registered through the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service, you will receive an email directly from the Registrar with a link for you to confirm or not confirm that you are the new owner of this domain. If you confirm that you are the new owner of this domain, you will have the option to check a box whereby you authorize the Registrar to act as you Designated Agent to confirm Changes for your domain on your behalf.

13.8 Fees

You agree to pay the then-current fees for domain name registrations and renewals set forth in the EarthLink price schedule for the billing plan you selected. All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, canceled or transferred prior to the end of your then-current registration term. EarthLink reserves the right to change renewal fees at any time upon thirty (30) days’ notice.

If you want to change your original billing information, you must do so by contacting EarthLink at least sixty (60) days before your domain name registration expires, otherwise your original credit or debit card or other method of payment will be billed. If your original credit or debit card has expired or is otherwise invalid, you must contact EarthLink with a valid credit or debit card or some other method of payment acceptable to EarthLink at its sole discretion. However, in the event that EarthLink does not have your valid billing information before the date your domain name registration expires, your domain name registration will not be renewed.

13.9 Additional Information Maintained

In addition to your WhoIs Information that you provide to EarthLink and EarthLink then provides to Registrar on your behalf, EarthLink maintains records relating to the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service that may include, but are not limited to: (i) any domain name application received by EarthLink, as well as any domain name registered through, administered, or renewed by EarthLink; (ii) records of your account, including dates and amounts of all payments and refunds; and (iii) any and all communication between EarthLink and you regarding your use of the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service.

13.10 Obligations Relating to the Information You Provide

You are prohibited from registering for the .us domain for a third party that is located outside of the United States.

You acknowledge and agree that willfully providing inaccurate or unreliable information or willfully failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement that will be sufficient basis for cancellation of your domain name registration. You further acknowledge and agree that your failure to respond to inquiries by EarthLink concerning the accuracy of the WhoIs Information associated with your domain name registration within 15 calendar days from the date that the email from EarthLink was sent to you will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for cancellation of your domain name registration.

13.11 Ownership of Data

You acknowledge and agree that EarthLink owns all databases, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in EarthLink’s domain name, the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service and other EarthLink proprietary information databases, and all information and derivative works generated from those databases. Additionally, you hereby grant to EarthLink a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up right and license to use in its business, however it evolves, including the rights to copy, distribute, display, perform, transmit, prepare derivative works from or otherwise use the following information: (i) the original creation date of a domain name registration, (ii) the expiration date of a domain name registration, (iii) the name, postal address, email address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of the technical contact, administrative contact, and billing contact for a domain name registration, (iv) any remarks concerning a registered domain name that appear or should appear in a WhoIs or similar database, and (v) any other information EarthLink generates or obtains in connection with the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service. EarthLink does not have any ownership interest in your WhoIs Information or other information other than EarthLink’s rights in its domain name database as set forth in this Section 13.11.

13.12 Agent for the Registrant

You agree that, if you are using the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service for another party, you represent that you have the authority to nonetheless bind that party as a principal to all terms and conditions provided herein including, but not limited to, the approval process for any Changes. You accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service. You agree that if you license the use of a domain name registered in your name to a third party, you nonetheless remain the domain name holder of record, and remain responsible for all obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to payment obligations, and providing (and updating, as necessary) both your own full contact information, and accurate technical, administrative, billing information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name and domain name registration. As further required by ICANN, you will accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name.

13.13 System Performance Degradation

EarthLink’s delivery of the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service depends upon its computer system and the computer system of its registrar, both of which are responsive to the demands of the domain name registration process. Occasionally, EarthLink’s computer system or its registrar’s computer system are subjected to exceptional volumes of incoming domain name registration requests, electronic mail messages, and/or WhoIs queries that result in significant degradation of EarthLink’s or its registrar’s system processing and response time. Regardless of the reason, in those instances when there is system performance degradation as the result of an extremely large volume of incoming electronic messages, EarthLink reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to filter or block electronic messages originating from the identified sources of the high-volume traffic. EarthLink will selectively restore service after system performance returns to normal limits, provided that such restoration does not result in an adverse impact on the system. EarthLink further reserves the right to permanently filter or block repeated sources of high volumes of electronic traffic.

13.14 Suspension, Cancellation, Transfer

You acknowledge and agree that EarthLink may suspend or cancel your use of the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service at any time, for any reason, in EarthLink’s sole discretion, including if (i) you materially breach this Agreement (including any applicable additional rule or policy; (ii) you use the domain name registered to you to send unsolicited email advertisements in contradiction to either applicable laws or customary acceptable usage policies of the Internet; or (iii) your use of your domain name does not comply with applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations.

You further acknowledge and agree that your domain name registration is subject to suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification pursuant to the terms of any rules or policies applicable to your domain name registration, including, but not limited to (i) the UDRP, (ii) any ICANN-adopted policy, (iii) any registrar or registry administrator procedures, or (iv) any other ccTLD registry administrator procedures. You also agree that EarthLink will have the right in its sole discretion to suspend, cancel, transfer or otherwise modify your domain name registration at such time as EarthLink receives (i) a properly authenticated notification from a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) an arbitration award requiring the suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification of your domain name registration.

If you contact EarthLink that you do not want EarthLink to renew your domain registration, then the domain name registration will continue until the end of the registration term. You may renew it yourself or transfer the domain name registration to another registrar.

13.15 Additional Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification regarding the EarthLink Domain Name Registration Service

**17\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS)**

17.1 Summary

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-955-0186. If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.

17.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
*   Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “EarthLink,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Services under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

17.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration

17.3(1) Notice of Dispute

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you.

17.3(2) Settlement Proposals

The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.

17.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution

If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.

17.4 Commencement of Arbitration

You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address. You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, https://www.adr.org. If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.)

17.5 Arbitration Procedures

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

17.6 Appeal

If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA. If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.

17.7 Arbitration Fees

Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

17.8 Awards and Attorney’s Fees

If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (the “Alternative Payment”), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney’s fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the “Attorney Fee Award”).

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in this Section 17.8 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses. Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.

17.9 Waiver of Class Actions; Limits of Scope of Arbitrator’s Authority

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.

17.10 Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 17 of this Version dated June 26, 2017.

**19\. MISCELLANEOUS**

You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired thereby. The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 17; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court. EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision. Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent. EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.

EarthLink believes that reasonable network management practices are necessary for EarthLink to provide all our EarthLink and PeoplePC residential customers, including residential broadband access customers, with award winning Internet services. EarthLink uses a variety of tools and methods to manage our network, including managing any network congestion, and address security concerns. Our industry standard network management practices help us protect our network and our customers from harmful online activity (like spamming, viruses and phishing) and help ensure compliance with our Service Agreements and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). EarthLink’s Service Agreements and AUP are available at [https://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces](https://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces).

So that we can address the ever changing issues and threats that affect our network and all our customers, we continually evaluate the effectiveness of our network management practices and reserve the right to change those practices. We will update this page to keep our customers informed of any significant changes to our residential broadband network management practices.

**1\. Network Practices**

EarthLink continuously monitors our network with the goal of providing all our residential customers with full access to all the lawful activities, content, applications and services that our customers seek on the Internet. When we find network congestion that may impact our customers’ use of our services, we work to alleviate the congestion by obtaining more capacity to support our customers. We do not restrict our customers by protocol, application, ports or devices except to protect our network and our customers.

EarthLink uses various tools and methods to protect the security of our network and, in turn, our customers. We have implemented several network-based security tools designed to identify and block malicious activity. We monitor for unusual login, firewall and other specific malicious network activity on our network. To try to reduce the delivery of spam emails to our customers, we check inbound email against several third party reputation services.In order to combat distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, EarthLink employs various practices which may include temporarily blocking certain incoming traffic into our network if we detect malicious activity or traffic volumes that exceed certain baseline metrics, or if the source of the traffic is potentially harmful to our customers or known to be associated with illegal behavior. We may block ports and Internet Protocol addresses and cancel or suspend customer accounts that are used to host malicious websites, send phishers or spam, launch malicious attacks, or attempt to steal customer information. In order to maintain the integrity of our network and our security programs, we do not disclose the specific details about our security tools and methods.

In addition, we offer our customers various security tools for the customers’ own use. Information on these security tools is available at [https://www.earthlink.net/software/staysafe.faces](https://www.earthlink.net/software/staysafe.faces).

**2\. Third Party Network Practices**

In order to provide high speed Internet access service to our residential customers, we use the DSL and cable Internet access services of various third parties. We work with these third parties in an effort to provide our customers with robust services. These third parties may have network management practices of their own that differ from EarthLink’s practices. If you have any questions or would like information about the network management practices of any third party that helps EarthLink provide high speed Internet access to you, please contact us or go to the third party websites listed in Section 3 below. To contact EarthLink Customer Service via telephone or live chat go to [https://www.earthlink.net/about/contact/](https://www.earthlink.net/about/contact/). To contact PeoplePC Customer Service via telephone or live chat go to [https://support.peoplepc.com/contact/contact.php](https://support.peoplepc.com/contact/contact.php).

**3\. Performance Characteristics**

As described above, EarthLink provides high speed Internet access service to our residential customers, in part, by using the DSL and cable Internet access services of various third parties. The performance of EarthLink’s high speed Internet access services, including the speed1 and latency2 of these services, depends on the performance of these third party networks and on many factors outside the control of EarthLink and its third party providers. Such factors may include the quality of your home network and inside wiring, the devices being used, and simultaneous usage by multiple users.

In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released studies and reports on the performance of certain nationwide residential DSL, cable, fiber and satellite broadband services in the United States, including most of the third parties that help EarthLink provide residential high speed Internet access service. The most recent of these studies examined and reported on the service offerings of the largest DSL, cable, fiber and satellite broadband providers using automated, direct measurements of broadband service performance delivered to the homes of thousands of volunteers during September 2013. For more information on the FCC studies and reports and the performance data go to [http://www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america](http://www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america).

2 Generally describes the time it takes a data package to travel from one point to another point in a network.

**4\. Commercial Terms**

In general, EarthLink does not place usage limits on our residential high speed Internet access services. However, certain third party cable Internet access service providers that EarthLink uses may limit the amount of data that customers can upload or download per month. More information on these limits can be found in Section 5 of EarthLink’s Cable Internet Service Agreement.

For information on all our residential high speed products and services, including pricing and available speeds, please go to [https://www.earthlink.net/](https://www.earthlink.net/access/). Please note our high speed product and service offerings vary by region, may change over time and may be subject to limited time promotional rates and conditions.

**AUTHORIZATION**

By entering my password and clicking on “Confirm” at the bottom of this page, I authorize EarthLink, LLC (“**EarthLink**“) to automatically deduct (“**ACH Debit**“) the monthly Internet access fees and any other monthly or ancillary charges or taxes associated with my EarthLink account from my checking or savings bank account specified above (“**Bank Account**“) at the bank specified above (“**Bank**“). I further authorize EarthLink to process any refund or other credit to me by electronic ACH credit to my Bank Account.

**PAYMENT DUE DATE**

I understand that EarthLink will initiate the ACH Debit from my Bank Account each month on the monthly payment due date of my EarthLink account.

**BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION**

I understand that I am responsible for providing EarthLink with valid and accurate Bank Account information. I agree to notify EarthLink if my Bank Account information changes. I understand that failure to do so may result in denied ACH Debit payments and cancellation by EarthLink of my bank draft as my method of payment.

**UNAVAILABILITY OR INSUFFICIENT FUNDS**

If my Bank does not honor the ACH Debit, I understand that I am still responsible for the timely payment of the related invoice, any overdraft fees applied by my Bank, and any returned item fees charged by EarthLink

**REVOKING MY ACH DEBIT PAYMENT METHOD**

I acknowledge that this authorization for recurring electronic ACH Debit will remain in full force and effect until I notify EarthLink that I want to revoke this authorization by (i) changing my billing method under “My Account” at myaccount.earthlink.net for EarthLink subscribers and myaccount.peoplepc.com for PeoplePC subscribers, or (ii) mailing a written statement expressly revoking this authorization to EarthLink Customer Service, 1439 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 (for both EarthLink and PeoplePC subscribers). I understand that EarthLink requires at least ten (10) business days after the date of such change in MyAccount or receipt of such statement to discontinue my ACH Debit method of payment.

**WHAT HAPPENS AFTER REVACATION OR CANCELLATION**

Upon the revocation or cancellation of my ACH Debit method of payment, my bill payment method will automatically revert to “Pay by Check” unless I specify an alternative bill payment method under “My Account” at myaccount.earthlink.net. If I allow my bill payment method to revert to “Pay by Check,” I understand that EarthLink will charge a processing fee each time I pay my monthly billing invoice. In order to avoid this processing fee, I must select an alternate bill payment method under “My Account” before the end of the billing cycle associated with the revocation or cancellation of my ACH Debit method of payment.

I understand that I may reapply for the ACH Debit method of payment with a different Bank Account. In the event that the Bank associated with such new Bank Account does not honor the ACH Debit, EarthLink may cancel my EarthLink account.

It is recommended that you print a copy of this Authorization and maintain it for your records.
