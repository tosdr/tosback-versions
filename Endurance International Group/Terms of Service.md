NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, ENDURANCE’S LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO US FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR $10.00.  THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT.  THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT. **Termination of Access.** In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to us under these Terms or applicable law, we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to the Site, at any time with or without notice and with or without cause.  In addition, we may refer any information on illegal activities, including your identity, to the proper authorities. **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Notice** We are committed to complying with copyright and related laws, and we require all users of the Site to comply with these laws.  Accordingly, you may not store any material or content on, or disseminate any material or content over, the Site in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by copyright law. Owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) to report alleged infringements.  You may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others without obtaining the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is our policy to terminate privileges of any user who repeatedly infringes the copyright rights of others upon receipt of proper notification to us by the copyright owner or the copyright owner's legal agent. If you feel that any content is objectionable or infringing, we encourage you to contact us immediately.  Upon our receipt of a proper notice of claimed infringement under the DCMA, we will respond expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the content in issue.  Our designated agent (i.e., the proper party) to whom you should address such notice is listed below. If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our designated agent with the following information:

*   An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest
*   A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed
*   A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site
*   Your address, telephone number and email address
*   A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law
*   A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in your report is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf

Our designated agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows: By Mail: The Endurance International Group, Inc. 10 Corporate Drive, Suite 300 Burlington, MA 01803 Attn: David C. Bryson, Esq. By Email: [legal@endurance.com](mailto:legal@endurance.com) Subject line: DMCA **U.S. Export Controls** Software made available to you by the Site (the "Software") is subject to United States export controls. No Software may be downloaded from the Site or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Downloading or using the Software is at your sole risk. **Applicable Law** Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or your use of the Site, including any claim based upon arising from an alleged tort, shall be governed by the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, regardless of your location, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. **Arbitration** You hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of these Terms.  The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be held at the AAA location in Boston, Massachusetts.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.  In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Endurance will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.  The arbitrator’s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and us alone.  Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties.  No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.  If you initiate a litigation or any other proceeding against Endurance in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay Endurance’s reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with its enforcement of this paragraph. **Severability** If any portion of these Terms shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions (unless otherwise specified) thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining portions (unless otherwise specified) thereof shall remain in full force and effect. **Miscellaneous** Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  These Terms and your use of the Site are personal to you and may not be transferred or assigned. Our performance under these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. Please contact us at: [legal@endurance.com](mailto:legal@endurance.com) with any questions regarding these Terms. These Terms were last updated on July 20, 2013.
