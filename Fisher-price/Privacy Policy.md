It also describes what information [_third parties_](http://www.fisher-price.com/privacy-statement#anchor-1) collect from you, and how we and they use that information. Key terms are italicized _(like this_) and can be found in the [DEFINITIONS](http://www.fisher-price.com/privacy-statement#anchor-1) section.

This privacy statement provides examples of data we collect, how we use it, and choices you can exercise. These examples may not be exhaustive or exclusive.

Mattel Sites are also subject to the [MATTEL TERMS AND CONDITIONS](http://corporate.mattel.com/global/terms-conditions-shared.aspx). Other terms, end-user license agreements, or additional rules may apply. Each time you use _Mattel Services_, you agree to this statement.

**Online Stores**

We offer opportunities to purchase products in our online stores, apps, or through other media or business partners. Online stores are often part of a larger _Mattel Site_.

*   When a customer places an order online, we will send a confirming email message.

**Enhanced Mattel Services**

*   Enhanced _Mattel Services_ may be available to you or on behalf of your [_child_](http://www.fisher-price.com/privacy-statement#anchor-1) for a monthly or other fee with some _Mattel Services_.
    
    *   Only a parent or guardian can register _children_ to participate in enhanced subscription _Mattel Services_ or certain community features at _Mattel Services_.
        
    *   To register your _child_, we will ask you to provide your [_login information_](http://www.fisher-price.com/privacy-statement#anchor-1) in addition to your contact details and credit card _information_.

**Apps**

We offer a variety of fun and engaging apps featuring our brands. In some cases, apps may be available through a Mattel Online Store; but most often when you download or purchase an app, or make an in-app purchase, you do so through a third-party mobile application online store.

*   Use of connected products typically requires downloading an associated app. 
    
*   Privacy practices for some connected products are the responsibility of a _third party_.

We may communicate with you on your mobile device. To receive _Mattel Services_ through a wireless connection, visitors must provide their consent and confirm their understanding that they will be charged by their carrier to send and receive messages according to their applicable service plan.

*   Should you wish to request the exercise of these rights as detailed above, we will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of products, based solely upon this request.

**Do Not Sell My Personal Information**

Subject to certain exceptions, as a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. To opt out of the "sale" of your personal information as described in this section, please visit the [DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION (ADCHOICES)](https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/?type=mattelccpa&pid=mattel01&aid=mattel01) page where you may take the following steps:

*   _Mattel Sites_: For the sale of personal information collected on _Mattel Sites_ through the use of certain advertising technologies, you may opt out by using the [ADCHOICES](https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/?type=mattel&pid=mattel01&aid=mattel01) tool or other instructions presented on the [DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION (ADCHOICES)](https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/?type=mattelccpa&pid=mattel01&aid=mattel01) page, including:
    
    *   Using the opt out instructions provided to you in the [THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LIST](https://www.mattel.com/sites/mattel_mattelcom/files/2020-10/Third_Party_Technology_List_Nov-20.pdf);

    *   Using Internet browser and social media settings.
    
     
    
    Keep in mind that, if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you may still see customized advertising displayed by advertising networks from which you have not opted out. In addition, your opt out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. Please also note that you will need to make such choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our _Sites_.
    
  
*   Mobile Apps: For the "sale" of personal information collected on our mobile apps through the use of certain advertising technologies, you may opt out by using the feature for limiting ad tracking on your device (if available) or, as applicable, by using the instructions found in the settings of the app.  
      
    Keep in mind that, if you opt out of interest-based advertising, your opt out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. Please also note that you may need to revisit such choices if you reset your phone or otherwise turn ad tracking back on in your device settings.
  
*   Catalogue: For the “sale” of personal information that occurs when we share certain names and mailing addresses of American Girl catalogue recipients with third parties as described above, you may opt out of the “sale” by providing us with your email address, first and last name and mailing address as detailed in the [DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION (ADCHOICES)](https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/?type=mattelccpa&pid=mattel01&aid=mattel01) page.

*   You may also contact Mattel at 1-800-524-8697 or American Girl at 1-800-845-0005 for assistance in exercising you right to opt out of the “sale” of personal information.

**California Shine the Light**
