Your personal information may be stored and processed by our vendors and service providers in the United States or other locations where the service providers or IKEA have facilities.

#### **6\. What are your rights with respect to your personal information?**

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information. If you would like to speak to us about any of your rights, please contact us (see section 11).

**International Transfers  
**We may share information about you with our affiliates and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above. Any international transfers of personal information will be in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable laws. By using our websites or mobile apps or otherwise providing personal information to us, you agree to the international transfer and processing of your information. While certain products may be sold outside the United States, including in the European Union, our websites and mobile apps are not marketed to or intended to be used by any non-United States resident.

**Your Nevada Privacy Rights  
**Nevada residents have the right to submit a verified request directing us not to sell their personal information. If you are a Nevada resident, and would like to submit such a request, please send your request to [infosec.dataprivacy.us@ikea.com](mailto:infosec.dataprivacy.us@ikea.com).

_**Your California Privacy Rights  
**_ACCESS TO SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND DATA PORTABILITY RIGHTS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the California Consumer Protection Act “CCPA” and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that companies disclose certain information to you about their collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. This right of access includes information about:

*   The categories of personal information we collected about you.
*   The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
*   Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.
*   The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
*   The categories of personal information that each recipient received.
*   The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.  
      
    

**DELETION REQUEST RIGHTS  
**You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the CCPA and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that a company delete any of your personal information that it has collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

**EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS  
**To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, California residents may submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

*   Calling us at [1-888-888-4532](tel:1-888-888-4532)
*   Submitting an online request [here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/privacy-policy/your-privacy-rights-pub3c56c880)
*   Requesting a submission card in-person at one of our California stores.  
      
    

The verifiable consumer request must:

*   Provide sufficient information that allows us to verify, to a reasonably high degree of certainty, that you are the person about whom we collected personal information. This may include requesting that you provide us with at least two or more pieces of personal information to match against personal information about you that we may or may not maintain and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verification.
*   Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  
      
    

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.  
  

**DO NOT SELL RIGHTS  
**You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the CCPA and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that companies stop selling your personal information and refrain from doing so in the future. IKEA does not sell personal information (as defined by the CCPA), nor does IKEA intend to sell personal information in the future. However, if you would like to submit such a request, please send your request to [infosec.dataprivacy.us@ikea.com](mailto:infosec.dataprivacy.us@ikea.com).

**AUTHORIZED AGENT  
**Only you, or a person you have designated in writing as your authorized agent, or who is registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf, or to whom you have provided power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request on behalf of your minor child.

If you wish to have an Authorized Agent make a request on your behalf, they will need to provide us with sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your Authorized Agent and we will still require you to provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information.

**NON-DISCRIMINATION**  
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

*   Deny you services.
*   Charge you different prices or rates for services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
*   Provide you a different level or quality of services.
*   Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services.  
      
    

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. For example, if you become a member of IKEA Family, IKEA will provide you with certain benefits and special offers in exchange for you providing your contact information, other information about yourself, and opting in to IKEA marketing communications. More details are available at the IKEA Family website, the IKEA Family FAQ, and IKEA’s Terms of Use.

If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request a list of all third parties to which we, during the immediately preceding calendar year, have disclosed certain personally identifiable information for direct marketing purposes. IKEA does not share personal information about its consumers with any third parties outside the IKEA corporate family for their own marketing purposes. We are only required to respond to a customer request once during any calendar year. To make such a request you should send a letter to IKEA North America Services, LLC, Attn: California Privacy Rights; 420 Alan Wood Road, Conshohocken, PA 19428. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the California privacy rights requirements and only information sharing that is covered will be included in our response.

**8\. How do we keep your information safe?**

We take the security of your personal information very seriously. We have implemented various strategies, controls, policies and measures to keep your information secure and keep these measures under close review. We use encryption techniques and other safeguards such as firewalls and password protection. This means that your information is protected and only accessible by personnel who need it to carry out their job responsibilities, or shared with third parties as described above. We implement physical controls in our buildings that restrict access to your personal information.

**9\. How long do we retain your information?**

In general, we will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of the information and the reason that we have the information.

We suggest that you read the privacy policies of those sites carefully.

IKEA’s current Terms of Use are available [here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/terms-conditions/).
