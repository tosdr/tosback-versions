End User Data Privacy Notice
----------------------------

* * *

### Introduction

As a global leader in providing digital learning systems for educators and students, McGraw Hill is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of our end users. Whether you are using Connect, ConnectEd, Engrade or any of our other solutions, we collect Personally Identifiable Information that we use to provide, maintain and improve the solution. We are providing the below information so that you can understand how we protect and use your information. If you are under 18, we suggest that you review this information with your parents.

This information applies to all end users of our digital learning system. Since McGraw Hill is a service provider to your institution, your institution Educational institutions are best able to provide you with a full understanding of their privacy practices and more information on how their end user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected, shared, and used. To obtain more detailed information about how PII is collected, used, and shared by your educational institution, please contact the appropriate individual at that institution.

In limited circumstances, end users may also be customers of McGraw Hill and McGraw Hill may market to them as a customer. For example, end users may purchase products or create personal accounts in our web sites. In these circumstances, they would be treated as a customer. For more information on how your data is used as a customer, please review the Customer Data Privacy Notice. By contrast, this End User Data Privacy Notice applies to end users with respect to the information collected and processed as part of a course of instruction within the digital learning solution as determined by their educational institution or employer. Aggregated de-identified end user PII is leveraged by McGraw Hill to improve existing or develop new educational products and services.

McGraw Hill is a global organization. We follow privacy laws and regulations that are applicable to our company and our services in the areas where we do business. Should our privacy practices change, we will update it here, but more importantly, we will notify your educational institution in writing and obtain their consent before implementing any material impact to your privacy rights.

#### What PII do we collect?

**We collect PII, such as contact information and education details, in order to provide you with the product and/or service requested.**

We only collect the information required to provide, maintain and improve the digital learning solution you use. When you register, or are registered within one of our digital learning solutions, we collect your name, school, instructor, class, and login information. Once you begin using one of our solutions, we collect your input to questions, technical specifications, and other information about how you use the solution. You are not required to provide PII; however, in order to use certain services, we may need to collect certain PII for that service to function properly or for us to provide you with requested information.

Depending on the product, the PII we collect includes information from the following categories:

1.  Name, initials, and personal or business-related contact information
    1.  For our digital learning systems, we collect your name/initials and contact information when you create an account. However, we collect additional PII, or confirm existing PII, if you contact customer service with an issue or question.
2.  Education & professional information
    1.  For some digital learning systems, we collect PII related to your position as an educator or student. This includes the state, district, name of school, courses, etc.
3.  In some instances, we collect PII from third parties who provide single-sign-on functions via Learning Management Systems or related tools.

**We automatically collect computer metadata and content to provide, improve, and maintain our products and services.**

When you use our digital learning systems, we automatically collect certain information from you through the use of cookies, web beacons or other tracking mechanisms. This includes information about your experience such as your IP address, operating systems, pages viewed, and time spent.

Third parties also collect information automatically from you across websites and over time through the use of their own cookies, web beacons, and tracking mechanisms. This information is used to enable the functions of the digital learning system, as well as customize, maintain, and improve our digital learning systems. You may disable cookies via your browser or third party mechanisms. However, some features of our digital learning systems may not function properly without them. Third party cookies that we use include Google Analytics and Webtrends.

If you choose to communicate with or receive communications through our services via phone, text, chat, email, or any other platform for technical support, customer service, or other assistance, those interactions may be recorded and monitored to deliver the solution or information requested by you.

#### How do we use PII and on what legal basis?

As mentioned above, we use your information to provide you with the digital learning solution on behalf of your school, in order to meet our contractual obligation to you or your school with respect to the service. For example, to assist with identifying users across products and providing consistent service and to enable sharing of data between our products and your school’s learning management system.

We will also process your PII to meet our legitimate interests, for example to improve the quality of services and products.

Except as described in this notice, we limit the use, collection, and disclosure of your PII to the minimum level necessary to deliver the service or information requested by you or your institution. We do not collect, use, or disclose PII that is not reasonably related to a legitimate business purpose necessary to serve you. Your information may also be used in order to maintain and/or improve our services.

Some of our digital learning solutions will use your previous responses to customize your learning experience. This customization is designed to ensure the best possible learning environment for a student without directly driving any determinative outcome.

Provision of your PII may be necessary in order to use the chosen digital learning solution. Failure to provide us with your PII may preclude you from using the digital learning solution.

#### Do we sell or use your PII to market to you?

**We will not sell end user PII or use information from educational records for marketing purposes.**

We will not sell PII to other organizations, nor will we market to students using the information from their educational records (education records are defined as records directly related to a student and maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a party acting for the agency or institution).
