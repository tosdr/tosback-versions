================

Last Updated and Effective Date - September 1, 2016

**THESE TERMS CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES (SECTION 12), DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY AND AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY (SECTION 13), AND A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER (SECTION 18). PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.**

1.  **This is a Legal Agreement.**
    
    These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a legal agreement between you and NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises, LLC and its affiliates, including NHL Enterprises, L.P., NHL Enterprises Canada, L.P., NHL Enterprises B.V., and the National Hockey League ("NHL", "we" or "us") governing your access to and use of the websites and online services that display or provide an authorized link to these Terms (collectively, the "Services"). The Services include, without limitation, nhl.com, the NHL app, and NHL.TV (formerly known as NHL GameCenter LIVE and also referred to as NHL LIVE™, (collectively, "NHL.TV")).
    
    MLB Advanced Media, L.P. and/or a successor or permitted assign of MLB Advanced Media, L.P. ("MLBAM") may operate portions of the Services and you agree that MLBAM, its successors and permitted assigns, and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as third-party beneficiaries hereof.
    
    Please read the Terms carefully before using the Services. You may wish to print a copy of these Terms or save them to your device for future reference. Your use of the Services indicates your acceptance and agreement to be bound by the Terms. Do not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms. We may modify the Services or the Terms at any time, for example to reflect changes in laws or regulatory requirements. Any use of the Services by you after we post modifications to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of those modifications.
    
2.  **Prohibited Content and Activities.**
    
    You may not access or use, or attempt to access or use, the Services to take any action that could harm us or any other person or entity (each a "person"), interfere with the operation of the Services, or use the Services in a manner that violates any laws. For example, you may not:
    
    *   Impersonate any person or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your credentials, affiliation with any person, or the origin of any information you provide;
    *   Engage in unauthorized spidering, scraping, or harvesting of content or information, or use any other unauthorized automated means to compile information;
    *   Solicit, collect, transmit, store, or otherwise make available private information of any third party including, without limitation, telephone numbers, addresses, last names, email addresses, Social Security numbers, or credit or debit card numbers;
    *   Obtain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems, materials, information, or any services available on or through the Services;
    *   Use any device, software, or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services or any activity conducted on the Services or attempt to probe, scan, test the vulnerability of, or breach the security of any system, device, or network;
    *   Circumvent, reverse engineer, decipher, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, or otherwise alter or interfere with (or attempt, encourage, or support anyone else's attempt to engage in such activities) any of the software comprising or in any way making up a part of the Services. The use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security (_e.g_., password guessing programs, cracking tools, or network probing tools) is strictly prohibited;
    *   Use or attempt to use another's information, account, password, service, or system except as expressly permitted;
    *   Take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our network or infrastructure;
    *   Upload or otherwise transmit any communication, software, or material that contains a virus or is otherwise harmful to our or our users' computers, devices, or systems; or
    *   Engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits any person from using or enjoying the Services, or that, in our sole judgment, exposes us, users, or any other third party to any liability, damages, or detriment of any type.
    
    Violations of system or network security and certain other conduct may result in civil or criminal liability. We may investigate and work with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the Terms. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services for any or no reason at any time without notice.
    
3.  **User Submissions.**
    
    Certain areas of the Services may enable you to post comments, send emails, or otherwise post, publish, submit, transmit, upload, send, or otherwise provide ("provide") information to us or other persons. You remain fully responsible for the content and other materials that you provide to us or others in connection with the Services, including without limitation information, audio recordings, videos, photographs, documents, or other materials ("User Content"). You agree not to provide User Content that:

    The Services may also offer opportunities for you to transmit User Content via third party social networking websites and products ("Third Party Social Networking Features"). Any use of Third Party Social Networking Features is subject to the then current terms of use of the applicable third party website or product and not these Terms, unless you are notified otherwise, in which case the terms and conditions set forth in such notification will apply.
    
    If the Services permit you to provide us User Content, you may only provide User Content that is original and that you have the right to provide. By providing us User Content, you grant us a royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully sub-licensable, transferable, license to publish, reproduce, distribute, transmit, display, perform, edit, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works of, sell, offer for sale, export, and otherwise use and exploit your User Content (or any portion thereof) in any way that we want and in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in your User Content to the extent permitted by applicable law. You represent that you have obtained all necessary permissions from any person or entity identified in or implicated by your submission (including those shown in photographic or video content), and, in the case of minors, also from their parents or legal guardians, as appropriate.
    
    By providing your User Content to us, you agree to these Terms. If you do not want to grant us permission to use your User Content in accordance with these Terms, please do not provide it to us on our Services.
    
    We are not obligated to publish or use your User Content. The posting or publishing of any User Content or NHL Content (as defined in Section 7) is not in any way intended to state, suggest, or imply endorsement by the NHL, including as to the truth, validity, or reliability of the User Content or NHL Content. The NHL is not responsible for any User Content or NHL Content and has no duty to monitor the User Content or NHL Content posted on the Services.

4.  **Subscription Services.**
    *   Subscription Services. Certain Services, such as NHL.TV, may be available only through creation of a subscription account and payment of a fee ("Subscription Services"). Through such Subscription Services accounts, you will have access to the Subscription Services for a fixed term, which may renew automatically as described in these Terms. Please note that for Canadian users who subscribe to NHL LIVE™ or NHL.TV through NHL LIVE™ Media, Inc. ("NHL LIVE™"), the billing and payment terms in the applicable NHL LIVE™ Terms of Service will apply for these Canadian users and not the billing and payment policies of the NHL in connection with this service. For all non-Canadian users who subscribe to NHL.TV, the billing and payment policies of NHL will apply.
    *   Access Restrictions. You are not authorized to access any Subscription Services unless you (i) have opened a subscription account with the NHL (or, in Canada, with NHL LIVE™), and paid the appropriate fee; (ii) have received access credentials (including a username and password), and (iii) are using those access credentials. You may not assist anyone else in accessing Subscription Services on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing, selling, publicly offering, or offering to sell your access credentials or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through Subscription Services to third parties or otherwise in violation of these Terms. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and if you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your access credentials, you must promptly notify us. You are also responsible for all usage or activity on your Subscription Services accounts, including the use of Subscription Services by any third party authorized by you to use your access credentials. Such responsibility expressly includes any purchases made or other charges incurred on your credit or debit card in connection with your use (or an authorized third party's use) of the Subscription Services. In the event of any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity on your Subscription Services accounts, we may, in our sole discretion, terminate those accounts and refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies. You may be responsible for damages from any such fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity.
    *   Devices and Minimum System Requirements. Some Subscription Services, such as NHL.TV and other video services, are accessible only using certain devices that meet certain minimum system requirements. You should investigate Subscription Services before you pay for access to them to ensure that they will be compatible with your device, because we will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you subscribe are not compatible. For some devices, the payment for Subscription Services may be processed by the device provider. Those payments will be governed by the device provider's terms, including its cancellation and refund policy. Other restrictions, including restrictions on the availability of the devices or the Subscription Services in certain countries, may apply. Click [here](https://www.nhl.com/subscribe#devices) for more information on devices: [https://www.nhl.com/subscribe#devices](https://www.nhl.com/subscribe#devices)
    *   Suspension or Termination. We may suspend or terminate your access to Subscription Services at any time without notice to you. If we do so, you will not be responsible for fees associated with the Subscription Services after the termination becomes effective, but you will not have any other remedies against us, and we will not issue any refunds. If you have breached or violated any obligation under these Terms, you will not be entitled to any remedy.
    *   Billing and Payment.
        
        Please note that this subsection does not apply to Canadian users who subscribe to NHL.TV or NHL LIVE™. These users will be subject to NHL LIVE™' billing and payment policies.
        
        *   Age and Billing Authorization.By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age, that all information you submit is true and correct (including all credit or debit card information), and that you are the authorized holder of the credit or debit card.
          
        *   Fees.You agree to pay all subscription fees and other charges to your Subscription Services accounts, including any applicable taxes (including any applicable VAT tax). The NHL (or, where applicable, your device provider) reserves the right to change the amount of, or the basis for determining, any subscription fees or other charges for the Subscription Services and to institute new subscription fees or other charges effective upon prior notice to you.
          
        *   Sales Tax. For certain purchases made via the Services, NHL is required to collect sales tax (including any applicable VAT tax). In states or regions that impose sales or use tax, a purchase is subject to tax unless specifically exempt. Purchases from the Services are not exempt from sales or use taxes simply because they are made from the Internet or because NHL is not required to collect sales or use tax by any particular state or region. Whether any sales tax will be collected on a given purchase and the amount of tax charged depends on a number of factors including but not limited to whether the seller is present in a given jurisdiction. The purchaser is responsible for any applicable taxes not collected by NHL and certain states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return reporting taxable purchases for which tax was not collected by NHL and to pay such tax. For details, see the website of, or otherwise contact, the applicable taxing authority. If any sales tax will be collected by NHL in connection with a purchase, that amount will be shown either prior to the completion of any purchase or reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase.
            
            For Oklahoma purchasers, applicable use tax on purchases made via the Services may be reported and paid on an Oklahoma individual income tax return, currently Form 511 or by filing a consumer use tax return, currently Form 21-1. The referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the Oklahoma Tax Commission [website](http://www.ok.gov/tax/).
            
            For South Dakota purchasers, any applicable sales or use taxes on purchases made via the Services may be reported and paid on a South Dakota Use Tax Form, currently Form 1350, available with corresponding instructions on the South Dakota Department of Revenue [website](http://dor.sd.gov/).
            
        *   Automatic Renewal
            *   Monthly Subscription Services. For Subscription Services billed on a monthly basis, your subscription will automatically renew monthly during the current NHL season through and including June and annually prior to the start of the subsequent NHL season at the then-current NHL season's regular full monthly price, unless you cancel your Subscription Service prior to the beginning of the next applicable billing (and renewal) period. The primary credit or debit card you have stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account will be charged on or about the same date each month of your subscription during any NHL season and each subsequent year as set forth above. If we are unable to process these charges to your primary credit or debit card, an alternative card stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account may be charged. If you wish to cancel a Subscription Service, you have two options: (i) you may cancel your monthly subscription in its entirety (including the annual automatic renewal of the Subscription Service in subsequent years) or (ii) you may cancel your monthly subscription for the applicable NHL season, but elect to annually automatically renew (i.e., re-start) your monthly subscription in the following NHL season. To elect either of these options and cancel a Subscription Service, you may login to your NHL.TV account, access the My Account section and follow the applicable instructions, or send an email to customersupport@web.nhl.com. In no event will NHL provide partial or pro-rated refunds. Please see the Cancellation Section below for details regarding refunds.
            *   Yearly Subscription Services. For Subscription Services billed on a yearly basis, your subscription will automatically renew annually prior to the start of the NHL season each year at the then-current year's regular full yearly price, unless you cancel your Subscription Service prior to the beginning of the next applicable billing (and renewal) period. The primary credit or debit card you have stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account will be charged each subsequent year as set forth above. If we are unable to process these charges to your primary credit or debit card, an alternative card stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account may be charged. To cancel your yearly Service, login to your NHL.TV account, access the My Account section and follow the applicable instructions, or send an email to customersupport@web.nhl.com. In no event will NHL provide partial or pro-rated refunds. Please see the Cancellation Section below for details regarding refunds.
                
                UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT APPLICABLE BILLING (AND RENEWAL) PERIOD THAT YOU WISH TO CANCEL ANY AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU) TO COLLECT THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES (INCLUDING APPLICABLE VAT TAXES) USING ANY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD STORED IN THE PAYMENT PROFILE SECTION OF YOUR NHL.TV ACCOUNT.
                
        *   Trial Subscriptions. Access to a Subscription Service, including NHL.TV, may from time to time be made available on a time-limited free trial basis (a "Trial Subscription"). Please note that these Terms apply to a Trial Subscription. You may be asked to provide your credit or debit card information when registering for a Trial Subscription. In such event, your credit or debit card will only be charged if you do not cancel your Trial Subscription before the end of the Trial Subscription period. If we ask for your credit or debit card information and you do not affirmatively cancel before the end of the Trial Subscription, then your Trial Subscription may be converted into a paid subscription and your credit or debit card may be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time your Trial Subscription first began. By subscribing for a Trial Subscription, you: (i) acknowledge that the Trial Subscription is personal to you and may not be transferred or otherwise assigned to any other person; (ii) acknowledge that the Trial Subscription is intended to permit you to assess the Subscription Services for consideration of a full subscription to the Pay Service (a "Paid Subscription"); and (iii) acknowledge that the Trial Subscription may be subject to other terms and conditions specific to the Trial Subscription being offered, and your use of the Subscription Service during the Trial Subscription period will also be subject to such other terms and conditions and such other terms and conditions shall be incorporated into the Terms; and (iv) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD INFORMATION AND THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION IS NOT CANCELLED WITHIN THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR TRIAL SUBCRIPTION WILL CONVERT TO A PAID SUBSCRIPTION THE PRICE OF WHICH WILL BE EQUAL TO THE PRICE OF A PAID SUBSCRIPTION IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION BEGAN AND THE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD YOU PROVIDED WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BILLED BASED ON A PAID SUBSCRIPTION AS IF SUCH PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEGAN ON DAY ONE OF YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION.
          
        *   Cancellation. To cancel your subscription to Subscription Services, you must follow the procedures described below. If we do not list cancellation procedures for a particular Subscription Service, you should contact us at [NHL.com/contact](https://www.nhl.com/info/contact-us). Except as described below, we do not refund or prorate Subscription Services, or any other purchases made through the Services, for any reason. Requests to terminate subscriptions will be effective once the billing period in which we received the cancellation concludes.
            *   NHL.TV. Subject to applicable laws, if you are a subscriber to NHL.TV, you may cancel your subscription within five (5) days of initially subscribing or within five (5) days after your subscription has automatically renewed, and receive a refund of the subscription price; provided that if you sign up for NHL.TV again after canceling, the NHL reserves the right to deny further cancellation requests made within a single NHL season.

5.  **Video Services and Blackout Restrictions.**
    
    Blackout restrictions apply to Services which allow you to watch video of live games, or highlights, such as NHL.TV. With respect to NHL.TV, during the regular NHL season, Stanley Cup Playoffs, and Stanley Cup Final, the scheduled webcast may be blacked out and not available for live viewing if:
    
    1.  you are located within the applicable team's local telecast territory, regardless of whether that team is playing at home or away or whether the game is being telecast locally by a regional network; or
    2.  an NHL game is being televised nationally in your country or programming area.

    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the NHL and you, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision. NHL in its sole discretion may amend these Terms, in which case we will post the amended Terms within the Services. Your use of the Services after such amended Terms are posted will constitute acceptance of them by you. NHL may be required to notify you of certain events concerning the Services and your use thereof, and your use of the Services constitutes acceptance that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on the applicable Services or, if we elect in our sole discretion, emailing you at an address you have provided to us.
    
16.  **No Waiver.**
    
    Our failure to enforce any provisions of the Terms or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive our right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect to similar breaches.

    You may not assign these Terms or any rights or obligations herein without the prior written consent of the NHL and any attempted assignment in contravention of this provision is null and void and of no force or effect.

By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories, or jurisdictions.
    
    With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), the NHL and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution. If you and the NHL do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.
    
    ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR THE NHL WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
    
    The NHL and you agree that all disputes arising under these Terms that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that the NHL may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
    
    Any claims not subject to arbitration shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of state or federal courts in New York County, New York. The parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the forum is not appropriate or convenient.
    
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive the right to bring any Claim in any forum unless you provide NHL with written notice of the event or facts giving rise to the Claim within one (1) year of their occurrence.
