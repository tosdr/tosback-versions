Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and Parsec for the Services until Parsec accepts your order.
        
    2.  ### Payment.
        
        You agree to pay the applicable fees or charges to your Account via Stripe or another third party payment services provider used by Parsec. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your specified payment method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle. We may submit those charges for payment, and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Parsec reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Services or by e-mail delivery to you. You will be required to provide a valid credit, charge or debit card number from a card issuer that we accept as a condition to signing up for any paid subscription Services – your authorizations in this section also apply to our third party payment processor and any other company who acts as a billing agent for us.

Upon Parsec’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
        
    4.  ### Automatic Renewal.
        
        Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Terms. **After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at Parsec’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription prior to the Renewal Commencement Date, by logging into and going to the “Change/Cancel Membership” page of your “Account Settings” page. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please contact Parsec at [\[email protected\]](https://parsecgaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or log in and go to the “Change/Cancel Membership” page on your “Account Settings” page.** If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Parsec to charge your payment provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Parsec does not receive payment from your payment provider, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that Parsec may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your payment provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).
        
6.  Indemnification
    ---------------
    
    You agree to indemnify and hold Parsec (and its officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors) harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Services, (b) your violation of the Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations, or (d) your User Content. Parsec reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.

        4.

Continued use of the Services following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
        
    2.  ### Dispute Resolution.
        
        **Please read this Section 15.2 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with Parsec and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**
        
        .css-1081t4c{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Parsec that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English.**This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Parsec, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.**
        
        Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
        
        Time Limits. If you or Parsec pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
        
        Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Parsec, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator may award monetary damages, and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Parsec.
        
        Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Parsec in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND PARSEC WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
        
        Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.
        
        If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.
        
        Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement or an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
        
        Severability. If any part of this Arbitration Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
        
        Right to Waive. Any or all the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
        
        Small Claims Court.Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Parsec may bring an individual action in small claims court.
        
        Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
        
        Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets will not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
        
        In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York County, New York, for such purpose.
        
        You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: [\[email protected\]](https://parsecgaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Parsec username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
        
    3.  ### Export.
        
        The Services may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Parsec, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.
        
    4.  ### Disclosures.
        
        Parsec is located at the address below. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
        
    5.  ### Electronic Communications.
        
        The communications between you and Parsec use electronic means, whether you use the Services or send us emails, or whether Parsec posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive electronic communications from Parsec; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Parsec provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including but not limited to the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq. (“E-Sign”).
        
    6.  ### Entire Terms.
        
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. The word “may” means “has the right, but not the obligation, to”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Parsec is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Parsec’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Parsec may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms will be binding upon assignees.
        
    7.  ### Severability.
        
        If any portion of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
        
    8.  ### Copyright/Trademark Information.
