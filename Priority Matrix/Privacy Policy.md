Privacy Policy
==============

YOUR PRIVACY IS OUR PRIORITY
----------------------------

Built on world class web services, we take your privacy seriously. _Effective May 10, 2018._

* * *

##### Summary

> We respect your privacy and take data collection seriously. We will not disclose your emails or private information to third parties for private gains. We will do what we can to protect your data. We are in the business of providing services and our goal is to build a trusting relationship. We collect aggregate data like favorite color choices, geographic locations, or usage data that is needed for use of advanced product features, like Cloud Sync, or to improve our products for you and future customers. We will promptly, permanently remove any information that you no longer want shared upon request.

##### Privacy Policy

Appfluence values your right to control what information you do or do not want others to see. There is a trade-off between making it easy to find new groups, events, and friends, and making information available to unwanted individuals or corporations. Appfluence recognizes that people have their own comfort level with privacy, and we give users a number of controls over how much information they want to make public. By using Appfluence, you certify that you have read, understand, and agree with the provisions of our privacy policy.

##### Information Appfluence Collects

Appfluence collects the following types of information, some of which can be considered personal:

1.  **Aggregate data** that is not personally identifiable for marketing and/or product enhancement. This may be shared with a third party.
2.  **Project information** that is synchronized to our servers, where it is stored to provide backup and sync services for a given user account. We do not share this information with anyone outside Appfluence.
3.  **Device id, ip and email address**, for the purpose of differentiating user accounts. This information is never given to a third party.
4.  **Email address**, in order to message our users about assignments, deadlines and other important notifications from the system, as well as invoices, training sessions and other information about or products. This information is never given to a third party without consent.

##### Data Access, Retention and Deletion

Users can access all their data, and export a machine-readable bundle file using our account management console. We will promptly honor requests to delete all data on any user, complying as soon as possible, but in any case within one month since your request. Simply contact our privacy address listed below and we will be happy to assist. We store user data in data centers provided and managed by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Unless otherwise stated, all our data resides in data centers inside the United States. Data is secured both in transit and at rest by industry standard encryption algorithms. More details are available upon qualified inquiries. Appfluence retains user data for the duration of an account’s active lifetime. User data will be deleted upon request by the account owner, or after seven (7) years without account activity, following sufficient notice to the user via email, in order to facilitate reactivation or data exporting if necessary.

##### What are your data protection rights?

Appfluence would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following: **The right to access**: You have the right to request Appfluence for copies of your personal data. We may charge you a small fee for this service. **The right to rectification**: You have the right to request that Appfluence correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Appfluence to complete the information you believe is incomplete. **The right to erasure** – You have the right to request that Appfluence erase your personal data, under certain conditions. **The right to restrict processing**: You have the right to request that Appfluence restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions. **The right to object to processing**: You have the right to object to Appfluence’s processing of your personal data, under certain conditions. **The right to data portability**: You have the right to request that Appfluence transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.
