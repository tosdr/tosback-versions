#### Programme Classification Information 

RTE operate an onscreen programme classification system to let viewers know more about the content of scheduled programmes. Icons will appear on screen for 20 seconds at the start of each programme which will help people make informed decision to view or not to view.

The four classification categories are:    

**(GA) General Audience:** Indicates a programme suitable for all ages and tastes

**(CH)  Children:** Indicates a programme aimed specifically at children, including pre-teen or young teenage audiences

**(PS) Parental Supervision:** Indicates a programme aimed a mature audience. It might deal with adult themes, be moderately violent or frightening, or contain infrequent bad language. This classification label invites parents or guardians to consider restricting children’s access

**(MA) Mature Audience:** Indicates a typically post-watershed (9.00pm) programme which might contain scenes of violence, sexual activity, bad language or adult themes.
