Thanks for using RSpace! These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use and access to the services, client software and websites (“Services”) provided by ResearchSpace. Our [Privacy Policy](http://researchspace.com/terms-conditions/#privacy "Privacy Policy") explains how we collect and use your information while our [Acceptable Use Policy](http://researchspace.com/terms-conditions/#acceptableUse "Acceptable Use") outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, and to review our [Privacy](http://researchspace.com/terms-conditions/#privacy "Privacy Policy") and [Acceptable Use](http://researchspace.com/terms-conditions/#acceptableUse "Acceptable Use") policies. If you’re using our Services for an organization, you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.

Your Things & Your Permissions

When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, email messages, contacts and so on (“Your Things”). Your Things are yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Things except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.

We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Things, backing them up, and sharing them when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Things. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with.

Sharing Your Things

Our Services let you share Your Things with others, so please think carefully about what you share.

Your Responsibilities

You’re responsible for your conduct, Your Things and you must comply with our [Acceptable Use Policy](http://researchspace.com/terms-conditions/#acceptableUse "Acceptable Use"). Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.

We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our [Acceptable Use Policy](http://researchspace.com/terms-conditions/#acceptableUse "Acceptable Use"). With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren’t responsible for the content people enter and share via the Services.

Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don’t have access to it, and keep your account information current.

Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you’re over 13.

Software

Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“Software”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

Our Things

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, RSpace trademark, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.

Copyright

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using the standard DMCA takedown notice format (see example template [here](https://www.dmcaagentservice.com/dmca-takedown-notice/)). We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.  Notices of alleged copyright infringement on the Services  should be sent to:

RSpace Enterprise

_Using RSpace Enterprise_. If you join an RSpace Enterprise account, you must use it in compliance with your employer’s terms and policies. Please note that RSpace Enterprise accounts are subject to your employer’s control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your RSpace Enterprise account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to an RSpace Enterprises account.

Termination

You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you’re not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others’ use of the Services. We reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you haven’t accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We’ll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.

Services “AS IS”

We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can’t guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RESEARCHSPACE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL RESEARCHSPACE BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT RESEARCHSPACE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN US$20. Some states don’t allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Resolving Disputes

_Let’s Try To Sort Things Out First_. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against ResearchSpace, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting info@researchspace.com. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or ResearchSpace may bring a formal proceeding.

_We Both Agree To Arbitrate_. You and ResearchSpace agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.

_Arbitration Procedures_. The [Scottish Arbitration Centre](http://www.scottisharbitrationcentre.org/) (SAC) will administer the arbitration under the [Scottish Arbitration Rules](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/1/schedule/1). The arbitration will be held in Scotland, or any other location we agree to.

_Arbitration Fees_. The SAC rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.

_Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate_.  Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

_No Class Actions_. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.

_Judicial forum for disputes_. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and ResearchSpace agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts of Scotland.  Both you and ResearchSpace consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

Controlling Law

These Terms will be governed by Scottish law except for its conflicts of laws principles.

Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ResearchSpace with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.

Waiver, Severability & Assignment

ResearchSpace’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. ResearchSpace may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

Modifications

We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

RSpace Privacy Policy

This Policy describes how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our websites, software and services (“Services”).

What & Why

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:

_Account_. We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, and payment info (if relevant). Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers.

_Services_. When you use our Services, we store, process and transmit your files and documents you create.

_Usage_. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

_Cookies and other technologies_. We use technologies like cookies to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.

With whom

We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third-parties.

_Others working for ResearchSpace_. ResearchSpace uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

_Other users_. Our Services display information like your name and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. Certain features let you make additional information available to other users.

_Other applications_. You can also give third parties access to your information and account. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.

_RSpace Enterprise Admins_. If you are an RSpace Enterprise user, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your RSpace Enterprise account. Please refer to your employer’s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not an RSpace Enterprise user but interact with an RSpace Enterprise user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address and IP address that were associated with your account at the time of that interaction.

_Law & Order_. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of RSpace or our users; or (d) protect RSpace’s property rights.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users’ data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our services or on their home computer’s hard drive. We’ll abide by the following principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests for our users’ data:

*   Be transparent,
*   Fight blanket requests,
*   Protect all users, and
*   Provide trusted services.

How

_Security_. We are committed to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account.

_Retention_. We’ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we’ll also delete this information. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.

Where

_Around the world_. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit information in locations around the world – including those outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.

Changes

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.

RSpace Acceptable Use Policy

We trust you to use our services responsibly.

In exchange, you agree not to misuse the RSpace services (“Services”) or help anyone else to do so. For example, you must not even try to do any of the following in connection with the Services:
