Terms of Service
================

1.  Acceptance of the Terms of Service
    ----------------------------------
    
    Welcome to **Taskade!** (a.k.a. “**we**” or “**us**” or the “**Company**”). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these “**Terms of Service** ”) apply to your use of www.Taskade.com, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Taskade.com (the “**Website** ”). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here: [Privacy Policy](https://www.taskade.com/privacy).
    
    We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Taskade, because **by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.**
    
    Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we’ll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at [support@taskade.com](mailto:support@taskade.com). We’ll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.
    
2.  Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    Taskade is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way. Of course, this document is public on Taskade, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version. **Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes**
    
3.  Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy
    -------------------------------------------
    
    We are working hard on improving Taskade, but we can’t guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).
    
    To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Taskade in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. “kjSA&\*-\_Y@#Ba”) and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.
    
    It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.
    
    We use SSL encrypted browsing for all logged-in users, but we cannot guarantee that all use will be secure. We also do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.taskade.com/privacy).

    **Your use of Taskade is at your sole risk.

    -------------
    
    You can pay to access paid features (turning your account into a "Paid Account"). We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. We will automatically update your account balance if you change plans or add or remove collaborators. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required to do so. You may cancel your Paid Account at any time but you won't be issued a refund. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it.

12.  Waiver and Severability
    -----------------------
    
    Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Taskade and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
    
13.  Modification of the Terms
    -------------------------
    
    We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website.

By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
