6.1 **Third-Party Sites & Ads**. The Sites might contain links to third party websites, services, and advertisements for third parties (collectively, “**Third Party Sites & Ads**“). Such Third-Party Sites & Ads are not under the control of the Company and the Company is not responsible for any Third-Party Sites & Ads. The Company provides these Third-Party Sites & Ads only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third Party Sites & Ads. You use all Third-Party Sites & Ads at your own risk. When you link to a Third-Party Site & Ad, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Sites & Ads.

6.2 **Other Users**. Each User is solely responsible for any and all of its User Content. Because we do not control User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content, and we assume no responsibility for any User Content. Your interactions and transactions with other Users are solely between you and such User. You agree that the Company will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. Except as set forth in the [User-to-User Payment Terms](https://www.makerbot.com/legal/user-payments/), if there is a dispute between you and any User, we are under no obligation to become involved.

6.3 **MakerBot Developer Program**. The MakerBot Developer Program provides software developers (“**Developers**”) with the ability to integrate their software application, website, or other software interface (“**Application**”) with the MakerBot Ecosystem. “**MakerBot Ecosystem**” or “**Ecosystem**” includes, but is not limited to, the MakerBot Cloud Library, MakerBot Desktop, MakerBot Print, MakerBot Mobile, MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers, Thingiverse, Thingiverse API, integrated Applications, and the MakerBot Library.

6.3.2 **User Content**. Company has implemented measures on certain User Content licensed under specific secondary licenses from being accessible through Applications. These measures mean that, subject to the terms of the secondary license that you selected as referenced in Section 4.1 above, you either: 1) need to provide your express permission in sharing User Content through Applications; or 2) you may automatically be opted into having that content be accessible through Applications. You may opt-out of sharing your User Content under 2) above by: a) revoking permission to the Application as specified on the Site; and/or b) choosing a different license. For secondary licenses for which you are not automatically opted-in, you may give permission to make your applicable User Content available through the Application by: a) granting permission to the Application as specified on the Sites; and/or b) choosing an appropriate alternative license. User permission will override the license. A User is responsible for the license they choose for his or her User Content. Regardless of such measures, the Company cannot guarantee that your secondary license will in fact be observed by the Applications. For all Applications, you are solely responsible for ensuring that their Applications comply with the secondary licenses. If you think a Developer is breaching your secondary license, please contact the Developer or Company.

6.3.3 **Tipping**. If you make your User Content available under Section 6.3.2 above, you may be able to make Tips (as described and defined in more detail in the [User-to-User Payment Terms](https://www.makerbot.com/legal/user-payments).
