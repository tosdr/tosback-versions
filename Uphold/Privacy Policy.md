Their value is derived from market dynamics and has historically been more volatile relative to fiat currency and other assets. The unpredictability of the price of cryptocurrency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear.

Anyone with access to the private key associated with the address can transfer the associated cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency transfers generally cannot be cancelled or reversed and the identity of the holder of the private key associated with any address can be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.
