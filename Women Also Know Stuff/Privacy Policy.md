This site uses Google Analytics to understand usage trends and server performance. We do not store variables which are personally-identifiable in Google Analytics like browser ids or IP addresses. Google's privacy policy can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy). If you would prefer have your browser stop supplying information to Google Analytics, Google provides a [browser extension](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) to allow you to do so.

This site also uses cookies supplied by Twitter when the Twitter sidebar script is loaded on the homepage. Their cookie policy is available [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies). Third-party cookies from Twitter are only loaded on this site's homepage and only when you agree to the terms or click the Twitter logo in the navigation bar.
