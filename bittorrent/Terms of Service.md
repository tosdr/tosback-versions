BitTorrent Terms of Use
=======================

Date of last revision July 15, 2013.

* * *

1.  ### Acceptance of Terms
    
    1.  By (i) using our products, our web site or any other web sites (each, a “Site”) or other online service of BitTorrent, Inc., its affiliates and agents (**“BitTorrent”**) with links to these Terms of Use (the **“General Terms”**) (collectively, the **“Services”**) in any way, including using, transmitting, downloading or uploading any Materials made available or enabled via the Services by BitTorrent or, you, or other users of the Service (**“Users”**), or (ii) merely browsing the Services, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to these General Terms and the [BitTorrent Privacy Policy](https://www.bittorrent.com/legal/privacy-policy/) which is incorporated herein by reference. **“Materials”** means any content made available or enabled by BitTorrent, you or other users of the Services and includes, without limitation, any (x) information, data, documents, images, photographs, graphics, audio, videos, or webcasts, (y) products, and (z) BitTorrent software code and associated documentation (**“Software”**). “**BitTorrent Materials**” means those Materials that are made available through the Services by BitTorrent or its licensors and specifically do not include Materials made by you or other users of the Services.
    2.  You may not use the Services if you are prohibited by Law (as defined below in Section 2(d)) from receiving or using the Services. Also, unless expressly stated in the Additional Terms for any given Service, you may not use the Services unless you are fully able and competent to enter into the conditions, obligations, representations and other terms of these General Terms and are either of legal age to form a binding contract with BitTorrent, possess legal parental or guardian consent or are an emancipated minor.  
        **In particular, unless expressly stated in the Additional Terms for any given Service, you affirm that you are over the age of 13 and acknowledge that these Services were not intended for children under 13.**
    3.  BitTorrent makes certain Services and Materials available only if you have paid a fee or have created a BitTorrent ID and password or other log-in ID and password (collectively, **“Account Information”**). Some Services may also be subject to a subscription or other agreement, posted guidelines, rules, or terms of service (**“Additional Terms”**). If there is any conflict between the General Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms take precedence in relation to that Service. The General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and all other documents incorporated by reference in these General Terms are referred to herein as the **“Terms”**.
    4.  BitTorrent may change the Terms from time to time at its sole discretion, including by imposing a charge for access to or use of a Service. If such changes are made, BitTorrent will make a new copy of the General Terms available at www.bittorrent.com/legal/terms-of-use, with any new Additional Terms made available to you from within or through the affected Service. BitTorrent may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Services is permitted. Otherwise, your continued use of any affected Service constitutes your acceptance of the changes.  
        **Your use of the Services is subject to the most current version of the Terms posted on or through the affected Service at the time of such use.Please regularly check www.bittorrent.com/legal/terms-of-use to view the then-current General Terms and Addition Terms.**
    5.  Services and Materials provided by third parties are governed by separate agreements accompanying such Services and Materials.
2.  ### Use of Services and Materials
    
    1.  You agree to adhere to all limitations on dissemination, use and reproduction of any Materials that you download or access from the Services.
    2.  Unless expressly agreed to by BitTorrent in writing elsewhere, BitTorrent has no obligation to store any Materials that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available through your use of the Services (**“Your Content”**). “**User Content**” means any Materials uploaded by you or the other users of the Services. BitTorrent has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or accuracy of any Materials, including Your Content, the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of Materials, or the security, privacy, storage or transmission of other communications originating with or involving use of the Services. Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to Your Content. You are solely responsible for Your Content. You agree that BitTorrent retains the right to create reasonable limits on the use of the Materials, including Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described in the web pages accompanying the Services and as otherwise determined by BitTorrent in its sole discretion.
    3.  You agree that your Account Information will always be complete, accurate and up-to-date. It is your responsibility to keep your Account Information confidential at all times and you are solely responsible for all activity that occurs to your Account Information when you are logged in to your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or Account Information, or any other breach of security, you agree to notify BitTorrent immediately. You may not use another person's Account Information. BitTorrent may require that you change your Account Information or certain parts of your Account Information at any time for any reason.
    4.  You agree to use the Services and the Materials only for purposes that are permitted by the Terms and any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practices or guidelines in any applicable jurisdiction (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other applicable countries) (**“Law”**).
    5.  You agree not to access or attempt to access the Services by any means other than the interface provided by BitTorrent or circumvent any access or use restrictions put into place to prevent certain uses of the Services.
3.  ### Ownership
    
    1.  The Services and BitTorrent Materials, and their selection and arrangement, are protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, trade secret, unfair competition, and other intellectual and proprietary rights (the **“Intellectual Property Rights”**). Except as expressly provided in the Terms, BitTorrent and its suppliers do not grant any express or implied rights to use the Services and Materials.
    2.  The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Services (the **“Marks”**) are the property of BitTorrent or third parties. You are not permitted to use the Marks without the prior consent of BitTorrent or the third party that may own the Marks. BitTorrent, μTorrent and the BitTorrent and μTorrent logos are trademarks of BitTorrent, Inc.
    3.  You continue to own all of the content and information that you own, which you post on SoShare; however, with respect to SoShare:
    
    1.  For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos and/or comments (IP content) that you post on or via SoShare, you specifically give us the following permission: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with SoShare (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
    2.  When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others) but also, prior to your deletion on SoShare, copies of such deleted IP content may have been downloaded by anyone else who was a member of that group to which you posted such IP content and/or forwarded by any member of such group to anyone else.
    3.  When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.
    4.  When you publish content or information, it means that you are allowing everyone who is a member of that group to which you posted, to access, download and use and/or forward that content or information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
    
4.  ### Use of Software
    
    1.  Any Software that is made available via the Services or otherwise by BitTorrent is the property of BitTorrent and its suppliers. If the Software made available via the Services is accompanied by license terms, then use of such Software is governed by the terms of such license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the hyperlinks referenced in the Software. Some license terms are available for review in the End User License Agreement (EULA). Other license terms may only be posted with the Software downloads or at the web page where the Software can be accessed. You shall not use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license agreement. Any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the license agreement provided with such Software, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that Software.
    2.  If no license agreement accompanies the Software, use of the Software will be governed by the terms of this Section 4(b). BitTorrent grants you a personal, worldwide, freely revocable, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive license to use the Software for personal, non-commercial purposes in the manner permitted by the Terms. You agree that you will not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of or distribute the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, decompiling the Software is permitted to the extent the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located give you the right to do so to obtain information necessary to render the Software interoperable with other software, provided, however, that you must first request the information from BitTorrent and BitTorrent may, in its discretion, either provide such information to you or impose reasonable conditions, including reasonable fees, on use of the Software to ensure that BitTorrent's Intellectual Property Rights in the Software are protected. You may not assign (or grant a sublicense of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software. For clarity, your use of the Software is also subject to the disclaimers and limitations in Sections 13 and 15 below and your compliance with the export control provisions of Section 18.
    3.  The Software may automatically download and install updates from BitTorrent from time to time. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new Software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit BitTorrent to deliver these to you with or without your knowledge) as part of your use of the Services.
5.  ### Use of BitTorrent Materials, User Content and Shared Group Content
    
    1.  Except as expressly indicated to the contrary in any applicable Additional Terms, BitTorrent hereby grants you a nonexclusive, freely revocable (upon notice from BitTorrent), nontransferable, license to view, download and print BitTorrent Materials, subject to the following conditions:
        1.  You may access and use the BitTorrent Materials solely for personal, informational, non-commercial and internal purposes, in accordance with the Terms;
        2.  You may not modify or alter the BitTorrent Materials;
        3.  You may not distribute or sell, rent, lease, license or otherwise make the BitTorrent Materials available to others; and
        4.  You may not remove any text, copyright or other proprietary notices contained in the BitTorrent Materials.
    2.  Some Services involve collaboration and file-sharing services among other users or a specific group in conjunction with such collaboration and file-sharing. The User Content that you or other Users share with other Users through the Services shall be referred to as **“Shared Group Content”**. While some Services offer functionality to limit another User's use of your Shared Group Content, such limitations are not guaranteed and it is your sole responsibility to determine what limitations, if any, are placed on Shared Group Content that you distribute. You agree that BitTorrent has no liability of any kind should other Users use, modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute your Shared Group Content in violation of the limitations that you may impose on its use. Further, it is your sole responsibility to determine what limitations are placed on your use of another User's Shared Group Content, including by looking at a given Service's functionality and Additional Terms along with any additional restrictions placed by such User on your use of their Shared Group Content
        
    3.  Software is subject to the additional provisions governing Software set forth herein.
    4.  The rights granted to you in BitTorrent Materials as specified above are not applicable to the design, layout or look and feel of the of any Services. Such elements of the Services are protected by Intellectual Property Rights and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part.
