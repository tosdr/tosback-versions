   consists of information about an individual which identifies or describes that individual,
   such as a name, social security number , physical description, home address or
   telephone number, educational status, financial matters or medical or employment
   history.  Under certain circumstances, such PII can also consist of non - identifiable
   information when it is combined with other informa tion which can collectively be used
   to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity.\
   The type of PII we collect from you includes any information you provide within your
   application for health insurance, including your contact information, social sec urity
   number, demographic, health or financial information and alien status.\

not permit anyone to identify you but may  allow Covered California to  identify your
computer or device on the internet.   Covered California does not collect , receive  or utilize
third - party cookies from other sites you may have visited.\
