Flat Justice Community Interest Company Ltd., 1 Floor, 85 Great Portland Street, London W1W 7LT
Flat Justice Community Interest Company (No. 11502292) is a ‘Not - For - Profit’ company that has a special structure under company law. Such
companies are designed for social projects and enterprises that work to help the communities they serve: they have to pass a 'community interest test'.
In our case, specifically, we help tenants of unlicensed properties Get Rent Back. The company has an ‘Asset Lock’: that means the assets of the
company are used to achieve its stated aims. Our ‘Articles of Association’ specify that, if and when the company should be wound up, the remaining
assets will be donated to Shelter, the housing charity.
