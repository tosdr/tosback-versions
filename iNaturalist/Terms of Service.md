**_Revised October 23, 2020_**

Read our Privacy Policy at [http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy](http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy)

Welcome to the iNaturalist website ("iNaturalist" or the "Website"). The following Terms of Service, in conjunction with the Terms of Use of the California Academy of Sciences website, available at [https://www.calacademy.org/terms-of-use](https://www.calacademy.org/terms-of-use) and the National Geographic Society website at [https://www.nationalgeographic.org/terms-of-service/](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/terms-of-service/), govern all use of the iNaturalist website, iOS App and Android App, the iNaturalist Network Member Websites, API, and all content, services and products available at or through the websites and apps (collectively, the "Website"). The Website is owned and operated by the California Academy of Sciences (the "Academy") and National Geographic Society ("National Geographic"). iNaturalist country portals in collaboration with iNaturalist Network "Members," are operated by the Academy and National Geographic. The Website is offered subject to Your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, the iNaturalist Privacy Policy at [https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by iNaturalist, the Academy and National Geographic (collectively, the “Agreement”).

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the Website, each user ("You", "Your" or "User") agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If You do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You should not access the Website or use any services made available via the Website. The Website is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old, unless parental permission has been obtained.

1.  **Your iNaturalist Account and Site.** If You create an account on the Website, You are responsible for maintaining the security of Your account, and You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must not post content to Your account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others. iNaturalist may, at its discretion, change or remove any content that it considers inappropriate or unlawful. You must immediately notify iNaturalist of any unauthorized uses of Your account or any other breaches of security. iNaturalist will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
    
2.  **Responsibility of Contributors.** If You post material to the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, You represent and warrant that:
    
    *   the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
        
    *   the Content is not spam and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
        
    *   You will post only Content that is relevant to iNaturalist and at a rate and volume that does not hinder other Users' ability to use iNaturalist;
        
    *   the Content is not libelous or defamatory, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
        
    *   Your account details do not mislead others into thinking they represent another specific person or organization (unique pseudonyms are allowed). For example, Your login name is not the name of a person other than Yourself or company other than Your own;
        
    *   Your content is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, journals and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods.
        
    
    By submitting Content to iNaturalist for inclusion on the Website, You grant iNaturalist a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting Your observations and journal via iNaturalist. We might also use the Content for other purposes not subject to known legal restrictions, such as training machine learning models. You represent and warrant that (a) You own and control all of the rights to the Content that You post or You otherwise have the right to post such Content to the Site; (b) the Content is accurate and not misleading; and (c) use and posting of the Content You supply does not violate these Terms of Service and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity. If You delete Content, iNaturalist will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but You acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made unavailable immediately.
    
    Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, iNaturalist has the right (though not the obligation), in iNaturalist’s sole discretion, to terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason.
    
3.  **Responsibility of Website Visitors.** iNaturalist has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating the Website, iNaturalist does not represent or imply that it endorses the material posted to the Website, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, non-infringing or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect Yourself and Your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. iNaturalist disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website, any mislabeling by Website visitors of observations, or from any downloading by those visitors of content posted to the Website.
    
4.  **Non-Commercial Use.** You agree not to use the Website, the iNaturalist Service, or any iNaturalist Content for commercial purpose or for any illegal, unlawful, inappropriate, or unauthorized purpose or activity. You further agree not to threaten, abuse, solicit, spam, harass, stalk, impersonate or intimidate other iNaturalist Users and not to collect or store any location or other personal information about any iNaturalist Users that You obtain from the Website, except for non-commercial research, conservation, and species management purposes.
    
5.  **Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.** iNaturalist respects the intellectual property rights of others, and requests that Users of the iNaturalist Website and Service do the same.

If You are concerned about the removal of or blocked access to Your content, please provide iNaturalist's Copyright Agent with a “Counter-Notification.” The process specified below is consistent with that provided under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Website at [http://www.copyright.gov](http://www.copyright.gov/)).

A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may not assign Your rights under this Agreement; iNaturalist may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
