*   Completing the “Delete My Information” form provided on our Contact Us page or within the “Do Not Sell My Information” link.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

*   Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
*   Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

_Response Timing and Format_

We will make every effort to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of receipt.  If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  The total period will not exceed 90 days. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.  For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

*   Deny you goods or services.
*   Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
