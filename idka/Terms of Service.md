The intellectual property rights to any shared digital resources remain with the User that created or uploaded the material. Any intellectual property rights to any digital resources such as posts, chats, texts, photos, videos, files, etc. created on or uploaded to the Service remain unchanged and rest with the person that uploaded or created the digital resource as it is, provided however that Idka and the Service are given the rights necessary to manipulate and manage the digital resources in order to provide the Service and provide functionality such as, but not limited to, encryption and “in-service” content search.
