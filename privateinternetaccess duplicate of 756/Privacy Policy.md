### PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT (“PERSONAL DATA”)

  

Personal Data means any information that relates or may be associated to an identifiable person. The personal Data will collect vary depending on your use of PIA’s Website or Service, as follows:

From Clients of our Service

*   E-mail Address for the purposes of account management and protection from abuse.
*   Payment Data for the purposes of processing payments as required by our third-party payment processors. Note that we do not save your full credit card details.
*   Cookie identifiers (see our Cookie Policy);
*   State or Territory of origin and zip code.

From visitors to the PIA website and Email

*   Information included in any submissions on the 'Contact Us' page.
*   The email address of any e-mails we receive.

### NON-PERSONAL DATA

  

Non-personal Data is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Thus, Non-personal Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. Non personal data we collect include:

*   Google analytics data (this data is anonymized).
*   Internationalisation (i18n).
*   System information.

### USES OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED BY US

  

*   We collect your name and e-mail address to send you subscription information, payment confirmation, customer correspondence and PIA promotional offers only
*   (to the extent you accept or subscribe to our marketing list). Additionally, we may collect state, and zip code to ensure compliance with our statutory tax obligations and for fraud detection.
*   Furthermore, we may collect payment data to manage client signups, payments, and cancellations. We may also process the above data in compliance with valid legal process, to comply with statutory obligations and to comply with contractual obligations.

The above-mentioned Personal Data is not, at any point, associated with any kind of activity done by the user inside the Private Internet Access VPN which is NOT recorded, logged or stored at all.

### WEBSITE REGISTRATION

  

You have the option to register on PIA website by inserting your username and password. The Personal Data entered is collected and stored exclusively for internal use by PIA, and for its own purposes. By registering on the website, the payment method, login ID, date and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties except as stated herein. Through registering on PIA’s website, you may exercise your rights as indicated below, through the website.

The registration of your data is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users.

### DISCLOSURE AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA

  

PIA strives to protect the privacy rights of our clients. We do not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Data with third parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your Personal Data to any member of our group of companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy.

Additionally, although we will comply with all valid subpoena requests, our legal team scrutinizes each and every legal request that we receive for compliance with both the "spirit" and letter of the law. For invalid or overly broad subpoenas, we will often question or attempt to narrow the scope of any subject matter sought. Moreover, when it is possible and a valid option, we will provide the user an opportunity to object to any requested disclosures. PIA will not participate with any law enforcement request that is unconstitutional.

Furthermore, we may share your personal information with third part service provides that we may engage to improve the Service. In particular, in order to assist you if you have questions while using our Website or regarding your order and provide comprehensive customer support, we offer the possibility of online chat. For the use of such online chat, you will be requested to provide Personal Data such as name and email. When a user visits the Private Internet Access online chat page we use Deskpro, Deskpro stores in its own database: visitor\_id (a unique identifier randomly generated when someone visits the page, stored in their cookies), browser used to log in, country, and date visited. Name, account ID, and email address may be collected and stored if this information is provided for support tickets submitted to Private Internet Access. We may also use Deskpro as a medium for communications, either through email, or through direct messages within the Deskpro platform. As such, any messages sent via live online chat, tickets, or emailed to helpdesk@privateinternetaccess.com will be stored on Private Internet Access servers. We may use the data collected via Deskpro in order to improve customer experience. Your data may be internally analyzed to understand trends in customer behavior, demographics, and selections. We will never sell information to any third-parties. Deskpro maintains its own separate privacy policy that is separate from Private Internet Access and can be located at [https://www.deskpro.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.deskpro.com/legal/privacy/).

PIA itself does not process any orders or payments. We work exclusively with payment processors such as Stripe, Amazon payments, Bitpay and Paypal. You can find information about the payment services providers' privacy policies and practices at [https://stripe.com/us/privacy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) (Stripe), [https://pay.amazon.com/help/201212430](https://pay.amazon.com/help/201212430) (Amazon), [https://bitpay.com/about/privacy/](https://bitpay.com/about/privacy/) (Bitpay), and [https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) (Paypal). The payment processors privacy policy governs the collection and use of the information collected during the check-out process which we recommend you review prior to placing an order or providing any information.

### DATA RETENTION

  

We may rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion as detailed above. Please note that unless you instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as needed to provide the Service and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
