================

This website, [wes.today](https://wes.today/), does not track you in any way, shape, or form. I don’t care if anyone reads this, or what you click on while you’re reading it.

I do not use tracking.

I do not use analytics.

I do not use any javascript.

I don’t sell any of the data I have, because I don’t have any.

Currently this blog is hosted on Gitlab Pages. Gitlab’s privacy policy is located [here](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/). Eventually I’ll probably self-host, but until then, this site will remain here.
